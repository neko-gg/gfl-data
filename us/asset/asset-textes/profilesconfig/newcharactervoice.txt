MG34|DIALOGUE3|Please don't scare me like that! Leaving guns out like this is dangerous.

TMP|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander... Umm...you haven't touched my tail today yet, have you? Please don't forget to do it.
TMP|GAIN|Co-Commander, pleased to meet you. My name is TMP...pl-please don't look at me like that! I'm begging you...
TT33|DIALOGUE1|Commander, can I speak to you for a second? If you are a so-called gentleman then you can't go around touching people like that.
TT33|DIALOGUE2|Commander, you're such a lecher...
TT33|DIALOGUE3|Commander, focus on your WORK!
TT33|SOULCONTRACT|Huh, Commander, what are you doing here?<>I can handle it here by myself...<>Huh? Pardon? "Business" between two people? I don't really get what you mean, but you'll show me right?
TT33|Introduce|Ah, Commander? I'm pleased to meet you.
TT33|ALLHALLOWS|It's not like I'm afraid of ghosts and monsters or anything...but it's okay if I stay with you, right, Commander?
TT33|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I'm not leaving until you go to bed. I'm going to make sure that I take good care of you, because after all, we've made vows to each other.
TT33|VALENTINE|Commander, today is... Please take this! It's nothing fancy but...I hope you'll accept it. Haaah, thank goodness! I'm so happy!
TT33|GAIN|Ah, Commander? I'm pleased to meet you.
UMP40|DIALOGUE1|Commander, let's play hide and seek!
UMP40|DIALOGUE2|Uwah! ...Huhu, you thought I was scared? It was a ruse!
UMP40|DIALOGUE3|Take me to the beach on our next holiday! You can bask in the sunshine while helping me put on sunscreen lotion~
UMP40|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, what did you need me for today? I'm going to go sunbathing in a bit...<>Eh? No way, right now? You're actually... That's great!<>I'm going to tell everyone that you are mine from now on!

UMP40|GAIN|UMP40 has arrived! Commander, let me help you get rid of those outdated has-beens!
UMP45|DIALOGUE1|I've been waiting for you, Commander.
UMP45|DIALOGUE2|With "9" here, you don't need anything else from me, right?
UMP45|DIALOGUE3|Play nice, Commander~!
UMP45|SOULCONTRACT|Despite knowing my true nature, you'd still accept me?<>...Hehe, worry more about your own future, Commander~
UMP45|Introduce|UMP45 has arrived. Commander, let's get along from now on~
UMP45|VALENTINE|Commander, I made this chocolate for you. Of course, I also prepared enough for everyone else... It's not bad, right?
UMP45|ALLHALLOWS|It's Halloween, isn't it! Do you like this festival, Commnader? ...Me? I don't hate it, it's lively after all.
UMP45|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Was I really out for that long? Missed me? You don't look like you did though... That's more like it. There's the dopey face that's so reassuring, hehe...
UMP45|GAIN|UMP45 has arrived. Commander, let's get along from now on~
UMP45Mod|DIALOGUE1|Is there something you need me to do? ...Hehe, I guess I should decide that myself.
UMP45Mod|DIALOGUE2|You're not bothered by my past, are you? Maybe you should be, because I want to tell you about it...
UMP45Mod|DIALOGUE3|Now I know that apart from your nose, you're quite unhappy with your life too, aren't you, Commander? Let me help you fix it all up~
UMP45Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Despite knowing my true nature, you'd still accept me?<>...Hehe, worry more about your own future, Commander~
UMP45Mod|Introduce|UMP45 has arrived. Commander, let's get along from now on~
UMP45Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Huh? I wasn't daydreaming. Do you think I'm anything like you? It was just... I realized that I've been living this kind of life with you for a while now. Well, I can't tell if it's because of your incredible silliness or if I've become the silly one.
UMP45Mod|GAIN|Let's get to know each other all over again, Commander... while I still feel that this world can be saved.
UMP45Mod|ATTACK|Let's move, 9. It's time for our payday.
UMP45Mod|SKILL2|Sorry, does it hurt? Not dead yet, huh?
UMP45Mod|HELLO|Oh, are you finally prepared to do your job? I hope you can make it, tee-hee♪
UMP45Mod|MEET|What kind of monstrosities will we face this time?
UMP45Mod|BREAK|Yeah... I really should've... hated you more...
UMP45Mod|WIN|I like how this ended, but I'm certain this isn't the end of it all, right?
UMP45Mod|RETREAT|This... isn't the outcome we wanted, but you and I all know what to do next time, right?
UMP45Mod|MOOD1|(Laughs)
UMP9|DIALOGUE1|Commander! ...Hehe♪ It's nothing!
UMP9|DIALOGUE2|45, are you here? Oh, it's the Commander!
UMP9|DIALOGUE3|What are you doing, Commander! I'm not in that kind of relationship with you yet...
UMP9|SOULCONTRACT|This warm feeling...<>Is this the feeling of "love"?<>With this, we can finally become a real family...
UMP9|Introduce|UMP9 has come home! Everybody, we're family now!
UMP9|VALENTINE|Commander, haven't you received quite a lot of chocolate today? ...Then it's ok to accept one more, right? Hehe♪
UMP9|ALLHALLOWS|Trick or treat!
UMP9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, are you heading out? As your family, should I be giving you a "goodbye kiss"? You were looking forward to it, right?! I saw it in your eyes!
UMP9|GAIN|UMP9 has come home! Everybody, we're family now!
USAS12|DIALOGUE1|It seems that I'm on duty today... I'll have to ask Saiga-12 if she has any more of those "instant noodles" later.
USAS12|DIALOGUE2|I'm a highly trained T-Doll, so let me teach you some "academic" combat strategies~
USAS12|DIALOGUE3|I-Is this how humans show their friendliness? ...O-of course I knew that! I'm very knowledgeable of this sort of things!
USAS12|SOULCONTRACT|C-Commander! ...What are you trying to do...<>Eh? I can be happy if I just wear this?<>A-Alright... As for how a happy life should be, I'll have you teach me.
USAS12|Introduce|You arrived a bit earlier than I expected. But this welcoming ceremony...it barely gets a passing grade~ Anyhow, I look forward to working with you, Commander~
USAS12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Eh? You want me to help with cooking again? Tch, you just want to laugh at me when I mess up, don't you?
USAS12|GAIN|You arrived a bit earlier than I expected. But this welcoming ceremony...it barely gets a passing grade~ Anyhow, I look forward to working with you, Commander~
USPCompact|DIALOGUE1|Commander, what is your order?
USPCompact|DIALOGUE2|I might not be the best T-Doll to have a conversation with if you want to chat, but I'll give it a try...
USPCompact|DIALOGUE3|What are you trying to do, Commander?! If I knew you'd be like this I would have requested for a leave today...
USPCompact|SOULCONTRACT|Eh? Commander, how did you come to notice me...?<>Sorry, you must have seen me getting carried away with my self-satisfaction...<>However, not being hated by you is really great. Commander, I really, really am thankful!
USPCompact|Introduce|USP...USP Compact, at your service from now on... I'm...looking forward to working under you...
USPCompact|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, what are you looking at? ...Eh? When did you record that? Please delete it immediately!
USPCompact|GAIN|USP...USP Compact, at your service from now on... I'm...looking forward to working under you...
Vector|DIALOGUE1|Advice? Will you even listen?
Vector|DIALOGUE2|It's okay... Don't worry about it.
Vector|DIALOGUE3|My origins, my prototype...are all meaningless. After all, I'm just a tool that follows orders...
Vector|SOULCONTRACT|I'd never expected a result like this.<>Since I've always been difficult with you, I'll take it as my loss this time.<>But, don't think that it's going to end like this.
Vector|Introduce|Oh? A new Commander? Well...let's all get along.
Vector|ALLHALLOWS|I love these kinds of things. I wouldn't mind if this sort of atmosphere could continue on forever~
Vector|VALENTINE|This is for you, Commander. Surprised? Heh. I don't want to be remembered as someone that doesn't give chocolate...
Vector|DIALOGUEWEDDING|How much longer can you keep up with this act? If you can't pretend any longer then say so. I don't want to believe in a lie...
Vector|GAIN|Oh? A new Commander? Well...let's all get along.
Vector|PHRASE|As long as you're happy...
Vector|BREAK|Are you serious? Stay away!
Vector|FIX|Can you leave me alone?
Vector|RETREAT|So this is my fate...
VZ61|DIALOGUE1|Commander, if you keep on touching me, I'll shoot you until you look like a beehive.
VZ61|DIALOGUE2|Don't underestimate me; my entire family has been used by many different organizations.
VZ61|DIALOGUE3|Skorpion is such a cool name, right?!
VZ61|SOULCONTRACT|To make such a decision like this, do you really understand me, Commander?<>Is that so? Then, I have nothing more to say. The past is the past, and the future...<>Let us face it together!<>
VZ61|Introduce|I'm VZ61 Skorpion~ Nice to meet you~ Even though I'm a scorpion I'm totally venomless.
VZ61|ALLHALLOWS|Commander~ Give me candy~
VZ61|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, come and look at this! It's my new painting of you! ...Looks like you, doesn't it? See, I can perform meticulous tasks too!
VZ61|GAIN|I'm VZ61 Skorpion~ Nice to meet you~ Even though I'm a scorpion I'm totally venomless.
WA2000|DIALOGUE1|Idiot...if I really hated you then I wouldn't be talking to you.
WA2000|DIALOGUE2|Listen carefully! Don't call my name so casually and don't touch my gun with your filthy hands!
WA2000|DIALOGUE3|Eh? My face is red? It's because...it's a bit hot today! D-Don't get the wrong idea!
WA2000|SOULCONTRACT|I'm a tool created solely for the purpose of killing, and I've never thought about anything besides that.<>Commander, are you sure you want me by your side?<>Hmm...with this, perhaps I'll become even more perfect.
WA2000|Introduce|My name is WA2000. Commander, stand aside and don't get in my way.
WA2000|ALLHALLOWS|Eek! I wasn't scared or anything! Ah! Don't bring that jack-o'-lantern any closer!
WA2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is there anything else left to do? Letting someone so valuable like myself be busy the entire day, you'd better reward me well after work, okay?
WA2000|CHRISTMAS|Since you look like you're free, and you look so pitiful being alone, I will accompany you for a bit...
WA2000|GAIN|My name is WA2000. Commander, stand aside and don't get in my way.
WA2000|HELLO|Where have you been? Do you really hate seeing my face that much?
WA2000|ATTACK|Die! Die! Die already!
WA2000|BREAK|Idiot, I don't need you to be worried over me.
WA2000|RETREAT|Um...Sorry...
Welrod|DIALOGUE1|What is it? Please send an encrypted message if it is an order.
Welrod|DIALOGUE2|I'm getting another cup of tea. Would you like one as well?
Welrod|DIALOGUE3|Tired already? Please leave the rest of the paperwork to me. I do have some experience with it.
Welrod|SOULCONTRACT|Huh?! What is this?<>...Eh? For me? Doing this in front of all these people, you're pulling my leg, aren't you?<>Ah...alright, just this once!
Welrod|Introduce|Welrod Mark II, reporting for duty. There's no need for a welcoming party nor flowers and celebrations for someone that operates in the shadows.
Welrod|VALENTINE|Here is some chocolate for you. I've confirmed that it has not been poisoned. Please enjoy it, Commander.
Welrod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I'm looking at pictures from when we went to the museum together. You were standing way too close, Commander...but...I'm fine with that.
Welrod|ALLHALLOWS|Costumes like these do not scare me. Things that are dead...will simply return to the darkness.
Welrod|MOOD1|Ahahaha!
Welrod|HELLO|Welrod Mark II. I've been waiting, Commander. Let us begin our mission for today.
Welrod|BREAK|Tch, is it over for me? There must be something more I can do...
Welrod|RETREAT|It won't end like this... We WILL have our revenge!
Welrod|BLACKACTION|Be buried by darkness, monster!
Welrod|MOOD2|Impossible!
Welrod|FEED|This power...I will control it.
Welrod|GAIN|Welrod Mark II, reporting for duty. There's no need for a welcoming party nor flowers and celebrations for someone that operates in the shadows.
wz29|DIALOGUE1|Commander, we are only fighting for the sake of peace...right?
wz29|DIALOGUE2|I want to live among the stars, because then, I won't have to hear the sound of gunfire anymore.
wz29|DIALOGUE3|Commander, is this your way...to show that you are friendly?
wz29|SOULCONTRACT|Commander... have you finally come to understand my ideal?<> I want to always stay by your side to protect you, so...<>Please, protect for me those beautiful stars that I can't protect myself...❤
wz29|Introduce|I'm wz.29... Commander, is there no other option...but to fight?
wz29|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Ah! Since when were you here, Commander? Don't tell me, you've been watching me this whole time...? ❤
wz29|GAIN|I'm wz.29... Commander, is there no other option...but to fight?
xm3|DIALOGUE1|A Commander's faults would manifest themselves on their T-Dolls, so make sure you reflect upon yourself regularly.
xm3|DIALOGUE2|Several groups performed atrociously in today's training, Commander. You expect me to be comrades with people like that?
xm3|DIALOGUE3|Well? This perfect form for sniping is surely more useful than some T-Dolls, right?
xm3|SOULCONTRACT|You've had your eyes on me this whole time, Commander? <>Well...I suppose it's hardly surprising that I've offended you many times... <>What? That's not what you mean? Then... Huh?! How could this be?! I...I'm not dreaming, am I?
xm3|Introduce|XM3 is an obscure weapon used by the USMC. Originally developed by IBA following DARPA's design to compensate for the limitations of the M40A3, it eventually garnered positive feedback in tests. I don't think this is due to improved weapons, rather it's because people have started to realize their own shortcoming.
xm3|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Do you understand what you did wrong on our last date, Commander? ...It's okay. I'll forgive you if you give me a hug...
xm3|GAIN|It is up to you how you wish to utilize me, Commander. Please make good use of this power from now on. I...I'm not dreaming, am I?
XM8|DIALOGUE1|Forget about that dumb battle plan of yours. I don't want someone who just sits around in an office all day tell me how to fight.
XM8|DIALOGUE2|Want to play chess with me, Commander? Don't worry, I'll make it a stalemate out of respect for you~
XM8|DIALOGUE3|I'm lighter than I look. Try lifting me up if you don't believe me.
XM8|SOULCONTRACT|Commander...I didn't think you of all people would make me feel embarrassed like this.<>To click with someone like me with such a bad personality, I'm nearly moved to tears!<>Perhaps the only person that can accept every aspect of myself...would be you, Commander.
XM8|Introduce|I heard there are a lot of interesting people here, but...you don't look very interesting at all. Don't disappoint me now.
XM8|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Thank you for your hard work, my dear Commander~❤ ...Hehe~ Was that too sappy for you?
XM8|GAIN|I heard there are a lot of interesting people here, but...you don't look very interesting at all. Don't disappoint me now.
Z62|DIALOGUE1|Yes, I'm here. Please give me your instructions.
Z62|DIALOGUE2|Commander, can you teach me how to solve this problem?
Z62|DIALOGUE3|Commander, read a book if you have this much spare time.
Z62|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, thank you for choosing me. In order to meet your expectations, I will devote my mind and soul to doing the best that I can!
Z62|Introduce|Star Z-62. Commander, I'm grateful for you taking me in and letting me join the team.
Z62|ALLHALLOWS|Tonight will definitely be very rowdy. I'd better stay in my room to read.
Z62|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, the books you've recommended recently are full of flair. We really are becoming more and more in sync, so I'll be counting on you from now on.
Z62|GAIN|Star Z-62. Commander, I'm grateful for you taking me in and letting me join the team.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUE1|You're really diligent, aren't you, Commander? I wouldn't mind even if you slacked off a bit.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUE2|Anthropomorphizing weapons... If you ask me, the form of a T-Doll is a bit too impractical.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUE3|What do you think of my painted nails? Want me to do yours?
ZastavaM21|SOULCONTRACT|...Hey, what's the matter? This is the first time I've seen you like this.<>If you ask me, this is not a wise decision at all...<>However, perhaps my sense of reality has become a little crazy because of you...❤
ZastavaM21|Introduce|About myself? Developed as an improvement upon the original AK series by Zas Arms, I was born out of humanity's long history in war profiteering. There's nothing much more to say. Perhaps human beings rely upon the evolution of their weapons to prove their own evolution.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, instead of thinking about the next date, why not think about how to make me happy today? Hehe...
ZastavaM21|CHRISTMAS|What will it take for me to believe in Santa Claus? If my bullets hit him... Just kidding.
ZastavaM21|GAIN|Commander... Yes, just as it says on the file, I am Zas M21. I hope you won't mind my performance.
CLEAR|DIALOGUE1|Nothing can replace me when I'm one with the music!
CLEAR|DIALOGUE2|What sort of melody can I play on a stage filled with smoke?
CLEAR|DIALOGUE3|Wanna see how I fight? Heheh... Then you'd better keep those ears perked!
CLEAR|SOULCONTRACT|I've foreseen this moment long ago... <>I always see my radiance in the depths of your eyes. <>Come... You're my only one. You're my only light!
CLEAR|Introduce|Feeling dazzled? Then stop running and seize it instead! This is the Glorylight that you've been longing for!
CLEAR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What genre do you fancy today? Haha! I can put the same song on loop if that's what you want!
CLEAR|GAIN|Feeling dazzled? Then stop running and seize it instead! This is the Glorylight that you've been longing for!
FAIL|DIALOGUE1|Learn to love your weaker self, because I love that side of you as well.
FAIL|DIALOGUE2|Hand your soul to me. I'll give you everything. Victory, melody, and all the love in the world!
FAIL|DIALOGUE3|Wanna see what's so cute about me? Haha! Better keep your eyes wide open then!
FAIL|SOULCONTRACT|Heheh...you've been looking forward to this, haven't you? <>Spin me around... Now I'm all you see! <>Come... Obey your only desire. Obey the one and only me!
FAIL|Introduce|Heheh... Are bad girls welcome in a place like this? Then let me show you the light shining from deep within chaos!
FAIL|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Still wanna try out more genres? No can do! You can only choose my favorite... Lose yourself in me!
FAIL|GAIN|Heheh... Are bad girls welcome in a place like this? Then let me show you the light shining from deep within chaos!
AUG|DIALOGUE1|We are tools used to replace humans on the battlefield. Therefore, a human life is saved every time we die in their place.
AUG|DIALOGUE2|I like rainy days. The rain lets my expression look...more natural.
AUG|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you will not have the chance for remorse for many situations out there if you act too rashly.
AUG|SOULCONTRACT|Haha... The floral fragrance here exudes an aura completely opposite of mine.<>I've always thought that only sorrow can make a person cry...<>If what I am feeling now can be expressed by tears...then I might not be able to stop myself.
AUG|Introduce|Commander, if you wish to send flowers to the enemy's funeral...then I am your best choice.
AUG|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, it seems like it will rain soon. Would you like to go for a walk? ...Bring a smaller umbrella so we can be closer together...
AUG|GAIN|Commander, if you wish to send flowers to the enemy's funeral...then I am the perfect choice.
AUG|ALLHALLOWS|With the mere presence of some kids with candy, even this silent night has become a little more endearing.
AUG|ATTACK|Don't get too far from the target.
AUG|BLACKACTION|The enemy will not escape our pursuit.
AUG|BREAK|Blood and tears......It's all the same to me.
AUG|BUILDOVER|I wonder what sort of flowers will bloom this time?
AUG|CHRISTMAS|Haa......Whenever this season comes around, I struggle to keep awake. Alas, no matter how satisfying my slumber, Santa's gift will never arrive.
AUG|COMBINE|At this rate, the number of funerals shall increase once more.
AUG|DEFENSE|Attack in moderation.
AUG|FEED|May this power continue to bloom......
AUG|FIX|I will not forget this pain......
AUG|FORMATION|Being together with everyone is my honour.
AUG|GOATTACK|I shall let this scent envelop the battlefield.
AUG|HELLO|Well then......It's time to move out.
AUG|LOADING|Commander, bring this flower along with you.
AUG|MEET|Allow me to offer up your funeral......
AUG|NEWYEAR|The past has come to an end. It is time to welcome a new beginning.
AUG|OPERATIONBEGIN|Alright, let us proceed as planned.
AUG|OPERATIONOVER|Commander, I've brought the goods you desired.
AUG|PHRASE|It's over.
AUG|RETREAT|Everything......has wilted......
AUG|SKILL1|Allow me to deliver your death......
AUG|SKILL2|Forget the sensation of living.
AUG|SKILL3|Do you all......shed tears?
AUG|TANABATA|I once made a wish, that my tears could flow. But now......I've given up on that.
AUG|TIP|This flower......It's emitting such a sweet scent.
AUG|WIN|The battlefield is a place where one must trample over flowers for the sake of victory.
AUG|VALENTINE|The commander's office is full of the scent of chocolate. It must be blissful to work in such an environment.
T77|DIALOGUE1|Understood, so it's a new mission... it isn't? Then what are you doing?
T77|DIALOGUE2|You can judge my mood by how many centimeters my arms are raised above my head.
T77|DIALOGUE3|...Commander, why are you so slow? ...No, that's not it, my eyes clearly didn't mean that...
T77|SOULCONTRACT|Commander... what's the meaning of this?  <>N-no, I was just worried that I'd gotten the wrong idea again... <>What the heck, it looks like you completely understood how I was going to react... ❤
T77|Introduce|...Huh? You still can't tell, Commander? You should be able to understand from a glance that I'm the new recruit, T77...
T77|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, our synchronization is perfect. I'm beginning to like how our mutual affinity feels...heehee.
T77|GAIN|...Huh? You still can't tell, Commander? You should be able to understand from a glance that I'm the new recruit, T77...
MP443|DIALOGUE1|Huh? Can't I have the diamond ring? It's so pretty... You're stingy, Commander.
MP443|DIALOGUE2|My sister has run off again. Finding her is harder than finding a rock.
MP443|DIALOGUE3|All these rocks have been meticulously sculpted by me. Nobody would even spare them a glance before they turned out like this.
MP443|SOULCONTRACT|Wanna turn me into your most prized possession, Commander? <>Looks like...my value as a "rock" has finally been recognized... <>Heheh, then from now on, I belong only to you... ❤
MP443|Introduce|Oh? I was only looking for interesting rocks. Didn't expect to find something even more interesting... I hope you don't mind joining the Rook's collection, Commander?
MP443|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Let's count how many rocks I found today, Commander? I'll give you whichever one you like... ❤
MP443|GAIN|Oh? I was only looking for interesting rocks. Didn't expect to find something even more interesting... I hope you don't mind joining the Rook's collection, Commander?
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUE1|Cino~ over here! Stay close or you'll be left behind!
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUE2|My clothes and Cino's turned out very well this time! Designing children's clothes is pretty tough, you know.
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUE3|How big is your hand, Commander? Let's compare!
Carcano1891_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, you have always been the most trusted person in my heart...<>Haha, sorry... "In a Doll's heart" would sound pretty weird, right?<>But as long as I am in your heart, then that's all that matters to me...❤
Carcano1891_0|Introduce|Carcano M1891, this name takes after the name of the chief technician that designed me, but people have also called me M91. I have fought through the three most brutal wars in the history of mankind, brought smile upon the faces of victors, and brought pain to the defeated... So, Commander, are you prepared for the consequences of accepting me?
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, it's important to be happy every day! However, there shouldn't be any reason for you to be unhappy as long as I'm around, right? Ehehe~
Carcano1891_0|GAIN|Carcano M1891 reporting for duty! I finally get to meet you, Commander! The justice and ideals you seek, I will witness them together with you!
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUE1|W-Wait up, sister! You're so slow I can't catch up with you!
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUE2|Lying children grow long noses. Mine hasn't grown, so I'm not lying.
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUE3|These are only clothes made by my sister. Touch it all you want. I don't care at all...
Carcano1938_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, are you looking forward to a vow filled with lies?<>...Even in lies, you would believe in me?<>In that case...regardless if it is a lie or not, every aspect of myself belongs to you now...❤
Carcano1938_0|Introduce|As a modified variant of my older sister M1891, I, Carcano M91/38, have also been a witness to many years of human history... Although I should've only been a witness, I have actually riddled that history with bullet marks... That is probably the biggest lie I've unleashed upon this world.
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|The people I hate the most, other than my sister, is you, Commander... Yes, I hate your expression that knows I'm lying yet is still playing along.
Carcano1938_0|GAIN|Hello, Commander. As you may notice, I am a joyful and lively T-Doll, so let's be good friends with each other.
FN57_0|DIALOGUE1|Hold tightly onto my hand, Commander. I'll be very upset if you get lost~
FN57_0|DIALOGUE2|You need to cultivate an appreciation for things from a young age, otherwise you'll end up with weird tastes like FAL when you grow up.
FN57_0|DIALOGUE3|It seems like I'm very popular. Is it because I can understand everyone's words?
FN57_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander...this moment has finally come....<>The more people and affairs I deal with, the more I lose myself, but you always pulled me back when I needed help the most.<>Thank you. Please let me stay with you from now on and become your most trusted partner.
FN57_0|Introduce|Oh my, you're my Commander huh? Well, you better take good care of me, because I'll have you fall in love with me soon enough.

FN57_0|GAIN|Oh my, you're my Commander huh? Well, you better take good care of me, because I'll have you fall in love with me soon enough.
PP19_0|DIALOGUE1|If I fight in this form...it might take the enemy by surprise. It's worth a try!
PP19_0|DIALOGUE2|No missions yet? There's a limit to a child's patience.
PP19_0|DIALOGUE3|Commander, I won't accept adults teasing me.
PP19_0|SOULCONTRACT|What is with that face, Commander?<>...Huh? What are you...? No, no. I'm asking why are you saying something like this all of a sudden! Don't look at me like that, I will also—<>I'm also... fine with it...
PP19_0|Introduce|PP-19 Bizon submachine gun excels in all regards, whether it's firepower, precision, magazine capacity, or stability. nI'm not bragging. After all, my bloodline is a mix of AK and SVD, and I have made use of many of their good designs while having my own distinct characteristics. ...Yes, this is the helical magazine. It's really unique, isn't it?
PP19_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is it because of this body? Lately I've been getting up later... Commander, could you wake me up?
PP19_0|GAIN|PP-19-01, reporting in! So you're the Commander eh? Well then, you'd better remember me!
CBJMS_0|DIALOGUE1|I'm growing up now, so I can't let the fish bones go to waste... (Nom) They're kind of hard...

CBJMS_0|Introduce|You didn't just pick me on a whim, did you? Do your best as my subordinate if you want me to believe you!

CBJMS_0|GAIN|You didn't just pick me on a whim, did you? Do your best as my subordinate if you want me to believe you!
Thunder50_0|DIALOGUE1|If we do not have "parents"...then can we truly be considered "children"?
Thunder50_0|DIALOGUE2|Only scars don't fade as you grow up...
Thunder50_0|DIALOGUE3|Is it time for "punishment" again? ...Oh, right, I'm not at that place anymore.
Thunder50_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, you've done well to sense what I was thinking. You should know how I feel right now...<>Though I'm not very likeable, please keep me by your side forever. Please, promise me.
Thunder50_0|Introduce|I've never seen your face before, are you new? ...Ah, excuse me, that should be your line, right?
Thunder50_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Black wings might bring misfortune, but you can still use them to fly... Commander, will you soar with me until misfortune catches up with us?
Thunder50_0|GAIN|I've never seen your face before, are you new? ...Ah, excuse me, that should be your line, right?
GSH18|DIALOGUE1|Huh? What? If there's anything, please let me know as soon as possible. Wait, wait! What are you doing!?
GSH18|DIALOGUE2|I don't think I disappointed anyone during the previous issue... I think... (Mutters) It should be okay... right...?
GSH18|DIALOGUE3|Commander~ want to move around a little? Sitting down all the time is bad for your body, you know. (Starts doing pushups) 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~!

GSH18|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What wonderful weather we're having. Commander, want to go outside with me? Hm?~ If you're not done with work yet, I'll stay behind to help too, but you need to promise me that we'll go out afterwards, okay?
GSH18|GAIN|GSh-18 officially joining! I can complete any mission no matter how hard it gets! Deploy me whenever!
TAC50|DIALOGUE1|My left eye can exchange visions with Maple Moon, which means you can access my visual input from Maple Moon.
TAC50|DIALOGUE2|I've prepared some snacks. Mashed potatoes with maple syrup, marshmallows with maple syrup... Hmm. They all look delicious!
TAC50|DIALOGUE3|Is this some sort of method to further our relationship, Commander? ...Okay, I'll try my best to cooperate...
TAC50|SOULCONTRACT|I'm not actually brave enough to try just anything, Commander. <>You're the one who's given me the courage to be with you like this... <>I hope...from now on, we can do our best together and try doing even more happy things, okay...?
TAC50|Introduce|I suppose my arrival means that I can try out all sorts of missions, Commander? Heheh, I can hardly wait.
TAC50|DIALOGUEWEDDING|When I'm not here, feel free to keep Maple Moon with you, Commander. Then I'll be able to serve you from afar.
TAC50|GAIN|I suppose my arrival means that I can try out all sorts of missions, Commander? Heheh, I can hardly wait.
TAC50|ALLHALLOWS|They say the voices of ghosts are a special kind of soundwave, so if we can synchronize with it, we might be able to speak with them.
M1014|DIALOGUE1|I feel very anxious every time I use the elevator here... It makes me very uncomfortable if it moves higher than 3.54 meters.
M1014|DIALOGUE2|I've finished preparing the conference documents. I went out of my way to encrypt them, so even if they get leaked... Eh? You can't read it? ...I think there's still enough time for you to learn how to decrypt it.
M1014|DIALOGUE3|These "wings"? Can I fly with them? Maybe, I think? I've never tried though, because I'm scared of heights.
M1014|SOULCONTRACT|This is what you called me out here for, Commander?<>Why didn't you tell me earlier? I would've made preparations first for something this important...<>Eh? I shouldn't overthink it? ...You're right. Maybe it is better to be simpler like this...❤
M1014|Introduce|Excuse me, are you the Commander? I didn't expect you to be this young; I thought you'd be the more older type... Ah, sorry, that was rude of me!
M1014|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I've made plans for our next date based on the data from our previous one. Of course, I've also encrypted them... Hey! Why are you throwing it away!
M1014|GAIN|Excuse me, are you the Commander? I didn't expect you to be this young; I thought you'd be the more older type... Ah, sorry, that was rude of me!
M1014|NEWYEAR|I have investigated various New Year's customs, and I didn't realize there are so many of them. Why don't we give them all a try?
FP6|DIALOGUE1|It's so noisy outside. Did someone get into trouble? Hehe...seems like my new punishment game from yesterday will come in handy.
FP6|DIALOGUE2|Commander, the meeting should start soon once I finish this chocolate. Finish up the work you have on hand.
FP6|DIALOGUE3|Noticed my hairpin? This is the key to the handcuffs. Don't lose it.
FP6|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, in a sense, you really are guilty.<>It seems like these handcuffs will not be enough to detain you.<>Allow me to keep you here forever beside me with this vow...❤
FP6|Introduce|Oh my...so it's you, Commander, sorry. You look so suspicious I almost mistook you for a criminal.
FP6|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, it seems like you've taken a liking to my punishment games. Is it really that fun?
FP6|GAIN|Oh my...so it's you, Commander, sorry. You look so suspicious I almost mistook you for a criminal.
AA12|DIALOGUE1|How do the other Dolls take care of their skin? I should ask on [Consultation Office] later tonight...
AA12|DIALOGUE2|It's so idiotic to use physical violence like a primitive being. An advanced Doll like myself should obviously solve problems in an advanced way.
AA12|DIALOGUE3|Hey, hey! Stop with the corporal punishment! I'm against violence!
AA12|SOULCONTRACT|Hah...I didn't think things would progress like this... What should I do?<>I should act more proper in a scenario like this, right? Let me think for a moment...<>Um...Commander...with me...together...I... Ahhh! Anyways, you understand what I mean!
AA12|Introduce|Hello, Commander, I'm AA-12. Pleased to meet... Blech! Trying to act all proper is making me sick.

AA12|GAIN|Hello, Commander, I'm AA-12. Pleased to meet... Blech! Trying to act all proper is making me sick.
PM06|DIALOGUE1|If only there were more red furniture in the dorm... Heheh, you hear that, Commander?
PM06|DIALOGUE2|It's boring to shoot at enemies that don't bleed. Just feels like a complete waste of bullets.
PM06|DIALOGUE3|Wanna go for a walk? Then you'll have to ask in the evening. I can't be in the sun at all.
PM06|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, can't it wait until later tonight? <>Whoa! Isn't this...?! Well, I guess there really is no delay for this kind of thing! <>Looks like we'll have to save some precious time this evening. Heheh!
PM06|Introduce|Oooooh! Is that your uniform? This mesmerizing red is just fabulous! I have a feeling we're gonna get along very well!

CETME556|DIALOGUE1|May I have a look at your battle plan, Commander? ...I see. So this is how far ahead you are...
CETME556|DIALOGUE2|556 and the others seem to be doing something really fun...N-No! This is time for work. I can't get distracted.
CETME556|DIALOGUE3|This box is exactly my size. It makes a good shield in combat and also comes in very handy when playing hide-and-seek.
CETME556|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, as a T-Doll, I have been relied on by many humans... <>But you are the only one I want to rely on. <>Now, could you please lend me your shoulder? ...Thank you for your cooperation.
CETME556|Introduce|Hello, you must be my Commander. Do you mind giving me a handshake? ...Thank you for your cooperation.
CETME556|DIALOGUEWEDDING|This is probably gonna be a busy day... Jeez. You'd better help me relax when I can finally catch some rest, Commander.
CETME556|GAIN|Hello, you must be my Commander. Do you mind giving me a handshake? ...Thank you for your cooperation.
OBR|DIALOGUE1|Could you give me two more days? I'll be getting my paycheck very soon... Ack, Commander! Nothing, just some weird prank call.
OBR|DIALOGUE2|So you're a T-Doll as well, Commander? I never noticed that befo... Who said that? It was Cino who told me.
OBR|DIALOGUE3|Alright, alright, I get it. Stop rushing me. Ouch, ouch, ouch...
OBR|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I know that I have owed you many things. <>Your recognition and trust are treasures that I can never repay... <>If I must, I am willing to return your feelings with all that I have.
OBR|Introduce|Are you the Commander? I have the right person, right...? As long as I work hard, my debt will... Hmm? N-Nothing.

A91|DIALOGUE1|Huh? Didn't you just go out, Commander? I must have gotten the wrong person again~
A91|DIALOGUE2|If you want me to maintain my operational capability, then I'll need a minimum of 660ml of vodka per day.
A91|DIALOGUE3|My perfume's quite intense, so don't get too tipsy, okay?
A91|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, there's one thing you probably don't know yet... <>Although I'm usually flushed in the face, it's not always because I'm drunk. <>Sometimes, it's because there's someone in front of me who is more intoxicating than fine wine...
A91|Introduce|Hm? Let's see who's come to pick me up? ...One, two... Hehe, there sure are a lot of Commanders here.
A91|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I get tipsy if I'm by your side even when I'm not drinking... I guess vodka isn't as potent as you are.
A91|GAIN|Hm? Let's see who's come to pick me up? ...One, two... Hehe, there sure are a lot of Commanders here.
Cx4Storm|DIALOGUE1|It's actually pretty difficult to collect cigarette labels here, since nobody smokes...
Cx4Storm|DIALOGUE2|Commander, someone like you could have easily done well in another job, so why did you choose to work here?
Cx4Storm|DIALOGUE3|Wh-What is it, Commander? You seem worried.
Cx4Storm|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, thank you for bringing me all the way here. <>I used to doubt myself and often wondered if I would be better off elsewhere... <>But now I'm sure of it. I'll find the happiness I was looking for by your side!
Cx4Storm|Introduce|I'm sure of it, I'll be able to find my true self here! ...I'm Cx4 Storm, and I'll be in your care, Commander!

M82A1|DIALOGUE1|A suggestion? Actually, I think... I'm sorry, I'd better not say it. I can't give you the answers you want...
M82A1|DIALOGUE2|Dolls cannot bear the prayers of mankind. We are not gods, and the only wishes Dolls can grant are their own.
M82A1|DIALOGUE3|There were once people who did whatever I told them... Yes, just like what you're doing to me now.
M82A1|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, how can you accept someone like me... <>All I can do is obey your orders and follow your guidance... Doesn't my selfishness hurt you? <>Maybe I can't give you the best answer, but when you can't bear it any more, please...let me be your pillar.

M82A1|GAIN|I'm M82A1... Commander, this is my name now. I am a Doll that belongs to you, and I will obey all the "guidance" you give me.
Python|DIALOGUE1|You have a good eye for tactics. However, I'm sure you'll get a better view from my perspective.
Python|DIALOGUE2|Dolls don't normally possess the instinct for "terror" that humans do, but I'll make sure to teach everyone about it.
Python|DIALOGUE3|Please be careful, Commander. Some snakes might not be venomous, but they'll be all the more dangerous because of it.
Python|SOULCONTRACT|Hehe, Commander, have you finally abandoned your struggles? <>Once I set my eyes upon my "prey", they'll end up mine sooner or later. <>...Or perhaps, was I the one being drawn in by the bait all this while?
Python|Introduce|Commander, are you my new "prey"? Hehe, don't worry, I mean no disrespect.
Python|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, what sort of "prey" do you want to take next? Whatever you want is fine with me.
Python|GAIN|Commander, are you my new "prey"? Hehe, don't worry, I mean no disrespect.
M870P|DIALOGUE1|Stop embarrassing yourself~ If I were to enforce the law with your mediocre work efficiency, my shells wouldn't even be able to reach 300 km/h~
M870P|DIALOGUE2|If you were to go on Highway 666, you'd best prepare some soda, otherwise I can't guarantee safe travels for you... Pfff, did I scare you into wetting yourself?
M870P|DIALOGUE3|Tsk tsk, I can't just pretend I didn't see this assault on a police officer. I'll give you the choice of receiving a ticket or barking like a dog.
M870P|SOULCONTRACT|Pfff... Commander, is this a new way of getting out of traffic tickets? <>Since you put so much effort into it, I'll let you off with a verbal warning this time~ <>However, if I lock my eyes onto you, then you can forget about escaping arrest, hehe...
M870P|Introduce|Pff...are you the Commander? If the license pictures of the idiots on the road all looked as typical as you, I'd rather be hit by a speeding vehicle~
M870P|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, it looks like I'll have to watch you closely today. My neural cloud won't let a single moment of your idiocy escape me~ So you'd better give me a good show, okay?
M870P|GAIN|Pff...are you the Commander? If the license pictures of the idiots on the road all looked as typical as you, I'd rather be hit by a speeding vehicle~

Mk12|DIALOGUE1|My neural cloud needs to store things that are worth recalling, not just boring work records.
Mk12|DIALOGUE2|If you need to sacrifice me on a mission, then please arrange a thrilling end for me.
Mk12|DIALOGUE3|You keep barking orders, but I already know what to do, so quit nagging me already...
Mk12|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, do you understand the implications of me putting this on? <>In truth, I've always liked tragedies, because I've never been able to choose "happiness" before...<>So please order me to put this on...because I've been waiting all this time for such an "order."
Mk12|Introduce|Commander, if you're only going to give me boring orders, I'm not going to play along with them.
Mk12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|The operation documents? I was worried you'd nag me for them, so I prepared them ahead of time. Don't be in such a hurry to thank me, as there'll a lot more things you'll have to be grateful for in the future.
Mk12|GAIN|Commander, if you're only going to give me boring orders, I'm not going to play along with them.
FNSPR|DIALOGUE1|To me, the best part about being an adjutant is being able to openly observe you like this, Commander.
FNSPR|DIALOGUE2|Well, we can't always depend on your orders all the time since you've got so much to do. Sometimes, we need to rely on ourselves.
FNSPR|DIALOGUE3|Ahhh, don't touch my hat! it'll be troublesome if I gets exposed.
FNSPR|SOULCONTRACT|I didn't know that you were always looking at me too, Commander.<>Walk closer to me and don't be shy.<>Let's enjoy a world where only we exist in each others' eyes...
FNSPR|Introduce|Excuse me, Commander. I was observing you for three days and three nights before coming here, but that was just some personal investigation. I hope you don't mind.

FNSPR|GAIN|Excuse me, Commander. I was observing you for three days and three nights before coming here, but that was just some personal investigation. I hope you don't mind.
Px4Storm|DIALOGUE1|If the company was more generous with its bonus plan, then I'm sure everyone would be more motivated. Wouldn't you agree, Mastermind?
Px4Storm|DIALOGUE2|Griffin work aside, I'd be glad to take on any odd jobs you have for me, Mastermind.
Px4Storm|DIALOGUE3|What? There's nothing that I want to buy, but don't you feel a sense of achievement when you watch your bank balance grow?
Px4Storm|SOULCONTRACT|After joining Griffin, I was expecting that under your command, I'd be able to complete some great job that nobody had ever done before... <>But I didn't expect that you'd even planned something like this out, Mastermind... <>It seems that whether it comes to plundering the enemy's fortunes or my neural cloud, you certainly cover all the angles.
Px4Storm|Introduce|Are you the Mastermind here? Ah, no...you're called the Commander here, right? Let's work together in future.
Px4Storm|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Mastermind, you need to tell me if you've got any plans. I can give you preferential treatment.

JS9mm|DIALOGUE2|Oh no! I think I'm on cooking duty today... I-Is takeout okay?

K11|DIALOGUE1|The reagent color doesn't look quite right... Commander? Nonono, you didn't see anything!
K11|DIALOGUE2|Hm...I think I should put a tank of nitrogen in the first aid kit, not that I know what good it'll do.
K11|DIALOGUE3|Do you want to see an explosion? If you do, then touch me again like you did just now.
K11|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, why did you call me out at a time like this? I haven't finished my experimental notes yet...<>...I can't believe you would actually say something like that.<>It looks like in addition to experiments and missions, I'll have to make space in my neural cloud for our memories together.
K11|Introduce|Guess who this is, Commander of Griffin! I'm K11, an expert at handling emergencies. Please let me show you my full potential!

MP448|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, that serious look on your face is making me feel a little... <>But never mind that, what's important is that I understand what you're thinking. <>After all, our relationship and our feelings have always been that straightforward, haven't they?

Type03|DIALOGUE1|Commander, when you order an attack, it mustn't just be in terms of the operation. You also need to deal a telling blow to the enemy on a psychological level.
Type03|DIALOGUE2|I will take care to record your words, Commander, and if need be, I will gather everyone to learn from them. My mission is to carry out your will.

RT20|DIALOGUE1|No matter what it is, I'll be able to tell if it's real or fake with a bite.
RT20|DIALOGUE2|You're always so secretive, Commander, and I can never tell what you're going to do next. Could it be you're actually behind some huge scheme in the shadows?
RT20|DIALOGUE3|What's the matter? Want a bite? Hang on a bit...have you washed your hands?
RT20|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, am I an irreplaceable part of your plans? <>Although I've never been able to tell what you're planning or what secrets you're keeping... <>I'm sure this symbol of our oath is real and true.
RT20|Introduce|Given that you need me, RT-20, to take the field, you must have a big objective in mind, don't you, Commander? I'm somewhat looking forward to seeing how you work.
RT20|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, let me decide where we'll have our next date... Where is it? Hehe, well...it's a secret for now.
RT20|GAIN|Given that you need me, RT-20, to take the field, you must have a big objective in mind, don't you, Commander? I'm somewhat looking forward to seeing how you work.
M200|DIALOGUE1|I have learned to play the guitar before. If you're bored, I can play a song for you.
M200|DIALOGUE2|Commander, I'm not too clear on this arrangement, can you explain why?
M200|DIALOGUE3|...No, you don't need to praise me for something like this... Oh my, my head feels really hot...
M200|SOULCONTRACT|Is there anything you need help with this time, Commander?<>What are you saying... Despite your embarrassing question, I'm not trying to run away at all...<>I'm such an idiot. Commander, I will do my best to ensure that you've made the best choice in choosing me... <>All the way until death do us part...
M200|Introduce|Hello, Commander, I am M200. I hope I can be of some help to you with my knowledge... No, I'm not an expert at all. I just hope to help, that's all...
M200|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Feeling tired? Please take a nap. I will have all the data organized for you when you wake up.
M200|GAIN|Hello, Commander, I am M200. I hope I can be of some help to you with my knowledge... No, I'm not an expert at all. I just hope to help, that's all...
Type62|DIALOGUE1|It seems like all the Dolls here are girls...although I do know of some Doll companies that use male Dolls as their unique selling point. Is this what's popular nowadays?
Type62|DIALOGUE2|Never in the science fiction films of the past would they have imagined that war in the future would be waged by a bunch of female robots with guns under a commander... Feels kinda lame, doesn't it?
Type62|DIALOGUE3|Uuwah you're so noisy! Don't you have anything else to do? Like some important work somewhere?
Type62|SOULCONTRACT|How are you feeling, Commander? ...Are you nervous?<>In the science fiction films of the past, humans and robots have always worked together to solve great problems.<>I think our story will be even more exciting than the movies.
Type62|Introduce|62 Shiki, reporting for duty! Nice to meet you, Commander! ...Hey, say something.
Type62|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Now that you're more and more competent at your work, you leave me no openings to poke fun at you anymore, Commander. I kind of miss it when you were a little more clumsy.
Type62|GAIN|62 Shiki, reporting for duty! Nice to meet you, Commander! ...Hey, say something.
Type62|NEWYEAR|I'm dedicating the entire day today to cleaning up the dormitory! Should I clean the Commander's room as well?
Type100|DIALOGUE1|Please let me know if there's anything I can help with, Commander.
Type100|DIALOGUE2|What are you doing, Commander? Do you need my help?
Type100|DIALOGUE3|Commander, I came here to carry out important orders, so please...stop while you're ahead...
Type100|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I'm sorry... I will do my best to work hard at winning your approval. I will not stop here!
Type100|Introduce|Official name "100 Shiki submachine gun", present! I look forward to working with you, Commander!
Type100|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Thank you for your hard work today, Commander. I've already heated up the bath for you...or would you like to chat a bit first?
Type100|GAIN|Official name "100 Shiki submachine gun", present! I look forward to working with you, Commander!
Type100|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. I hope we will have a successful year. Let's work hard together.
Type64-AR|DIALOGUE1|I don't think that Doll has talked with me before, even though we've seen each other around... Forget it, if I take the initiative, it'll feel like I've lost.
Type64-AR|DIALOGUE2|Am I bothered by anything? No, not really. I was just thinking about some meaningless things... I-I didn't expect you to be so concerned about others.
Type64-AR|DIALOGUE3|Alright, alright, you win. Please don't stare at me like that. You're making me all embarrassed...
Type64-AR|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, there are still too many things in this world which are "unknown" to me.<>Facing the "unknown" terrifies me, but as long as you're around...<>No, it's nothing. What I mean is, please don't cast me aside. 
Type64-AR|Introduce|This place is totally foreign to me...but since I'm here, I'll do my best to adapt. I'll be in your care, Commander.
Type64-AR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is this the location of our next date? I've never heard of it before...but since you chose it, I have nothing to fear.
Type64-AR|GAIN|This place is totally foreign to me...but since I'm here, I'll do my best to adapt. I'll be in your care, Commander.
Type64-AR|PHRASE|Huh? Me?
Type64-AR|SKILL2|Who are you? Stay away from me!
Type64-AR|BREAK|Urgh! I just knew...they wouldn't be gentle with me...
Type64-AR|RETREAT|What...went wrong?
Type64-AR|FIX|I'll be entering sleep mode soon. Don't peek at my face while I'm sleeping!
Type64-AR|HELLO|Huh? When did you show up?
Type64-AR|COMBINE|It looks just like me, but it still feels very foreign.
Type64-AR|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander... Oh, this? This is soba, one of the few dishes I can make. Would you like to try some?
Jericho|DIALOGUE1|Chin up! Chest out! Eyes forward! No smiling! ...Very good, Commander, I'm satisfied with your performance. Now keep this up all day.
Jericho|DIALOGUE2|I have to be strict, otherwise I won't be able to relax if I have to rely solely on a crazy little girl like Negev.
Jericho|DIALOGUE3|Are you quite done yet, Commander? Honestly, you're being terribly childish. I won't keep humoring you like this.
Jericho|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, we dolls only exist after we are granted "masks", and the range of emotions that we show had already been programmed beforehand.<>But you could see through that girl's "mask" and uncover her true nature...<>Commander, I'd like you to tell me the true story of the girl under that "mask"...
Jericho|Introduce|Are you the leader here? ...You don't look like it at all. Please act with more gravitas and don't take the position of Commander lightly.
Jericho|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I trust you didn't forget to help me water the flowers, Commander? ...If you don't make me happy today, you can forget about our next date.
Jericho|GAIN|Are you the leader here? ...You don't look like it at all. Please act with more gravitas and don't take the position of Commander lightly.
ART556|CHRISTMAS|Presents! Presents! We're going to get lots of presents today, right? I can hardly wait!
ASVAL|NEWYEAR|It's a new year, Commander. Have I grown a little? Huh, Teddy's gotten bigger? That's because I just washed him...
CZ52|NEWYEAR|Time will always give us a new answer, so let's continue doing our best this year.
CZ75|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. Why are you wearing so many layers tonight? You really can't take the cold, huh?
FN57|CHRISTMAS|This is a nice Christmas dress, don't you think? ...After all, I'm the one wearing it.
G36Mod|DIALOGUE1|My little sister sometimes comes to my dorm to sleep with me... Goodness, it's not like she's a child anymore.
G36Mod|DIALOGUE2|Master, these are the notes for the upcoming meeting. I've highlighted the key points, so you can use them directly. 
G36Mod|DIALOGUE3|Master, do you enjoy teasing me while I'm at work?
G36Mod|GAIN|Master, my services will be comprehensively upgraded. Please enjoy the experience.
GepardM1|VALENTINE|Commander, don't you feel that receiving so many chocolates is a burden?
IWS2000|NEWYEAR|Please rely on me throughout this new year, whether it's achieving victory in battle or a New Year's wish, I will help make them come true!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
KP31|WIN|Did we win? Wonderful, I can finally leave my name behind...
KP31|BUILDOVER|A new friend? Or are they...that bunch of brutes...
KP31|BLACKACTION|Rules were meant to be broken!
KP31|FIX|Can I please have...a room with a sauna?
KP31|FORMATION|Uuu...everyone, you don't need to crowd so close around me...
KP31|PHRASE|I'm honored.
KP31|VALENTINE|Commander, this is my chocolate. Place it next to the failures that those brutes made and examine the difference.
LWMMGMod|DIALOGUE1|Four boxes...six boxes... No, I don't think I'll use that much ammo on the next mission.
LWMMGMod|DIALOGUE2|Are you thinking about operation plans? ...No need to worry about me, I can take care of myself.
LWMMGMod|DIALOGUE3|Commander, it's not good for us to keep chatting like this... You still have work to do, don't you?
LWMMGMod|GAIN|Growth like this should mean that other people won't be so burdened by me... Thank goodness.
M14Mod|DIALOGUE1|Commander, we went on many exciting adventures again. Would you like to hear about them?
M14Mod|DIALOGUE2|Are you having trouble with something? Times like these call for folk wisdom, so leave it to us!
M14Mod|DIALOGUE3|Commander, your way of greeting is a little too intense for us. We...still need time to get used to it...
M14Mod|GAIN|Commander, don't you think we've become a little more mature? Right now, we feel like we can do anything~
Mk23|VALENTINE|While every day is like Valentine's Day, I'd still like to commemorate this day. Is there something you'd like to do, Darling?
MP5|NEWYEAR|I hope my chest will grow this year... I'll do my best!
OTs14|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year. I hope things will remain this way for the upcoming year, so I have something to look forward to.
OTs14|HELLO|Come, don't be so stiff, start by helping me make a cup of tea.
OTs14|RETREAT|Perhaps...we ought to rest a little and then have something to drink, in order to keep our heads clear.
OTs14|COMBINE|Thank you, now I'll have someone to wake me up.
OTs14|BREAK|I'm in terrible shape. As I thought, it's all because I didn't adjust myself properly last night...
OTs14|FIX|I'll let you handle this, then. I'm going to take a short nap.
PKP|VALENTINE|Are you surprised that I made chocolate? You seem to be under the wrong impression... I'm perfect in everything I do.
RFB|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year! What games do you want to play this year, Commander?
SAT8|FORMATION|What a nice place you left for me~
SAT8|MEET|So you came!
SAT8|DEFENSE|Wait a minute, I'm not ready yet...
SAT8|BREAK|Aw, I'm a mess now... I surrender, I surrender~
SAT8|RETREAT|Looks like I didn't prepare enough... I'll pull back for now.
SAT8|HELLO|Are you there? Shall we start by going over our preparations?
StenMK2Mod|DIALOGUE1|Ah! Commander, what should I be doing?
StenMK2Mod|DIALOGUE2|Mhm! I'm listening, so please continue!
StenMK2Mod|DIALOGUE3|Commander, do we already have that kind of relationship? If not, please stop making jokes like that...
StenMK2Mod|ALLHALLOWS|Commander, come take a look, this is tonight's Jack O'Lantern! I made it myself, is it cute?
StenMK2Mod|VALENTINE|Commander, I made some chocolate, but I don't know how it tastes... Would you like to try it?
StenMK2Mod|GAIN|Commander, have I grown enough that you can trust me to handle this task by myself? ...If you're still worried, then please keep an eye on me from now on!
T5000|VALENTINE|My chocolate isn't too special compared to theirs, is it? Mm, this will do.
TMP|CHRISTMAS|Another round, AK-47~ hic! ...You were the one who forced me to drink, weren't you~ Don't tell me you can't handle a little bit of alkie? Hahaha~
FN57_0|WIN|Hehe, the Commander's going to praise me. Don't get jealous now, everyone.
FN57_0|HELLO|It's a new day, Commander. Did you miss me?
FN57_0|BLACKACTION|The Commander's watching me now, I need to work harder.
FN57_0|FEED|You're really nice to me, I'll remember this.
FN57_0|RETREAT|Is there nothing we can do? I hope I'm not to blame...
FN57_0|FIX|Don't worry, next time I'll pay them back in kind!
FN57_0|BREAK|You really are heartless, aren't you? Can't you be gentler to a little girl?
FP6|CHRISTMAS|Alright children, remember to go to bed on time tonight. I'll be doing room inspections, so if you don't want anything to happen to your Christmas presents, you'd better be sound asleep.
AK74U|NEWYEAR|Do your best for the new year, Boss. Don't get me wrong, I'm just saying auspicious things to suit the occasion. Hurry up and thank me!
Px4Storm|CHRISTMAS|Not only do I believe in Santa Claus, I also respect him deeply. Why? It's because there's nowhere in this world that he can't enter!
Px4Storm|WIN|High-risk work that pays well. I expected nothing less of Griffin.
Px4Storm|HELLO|Did you come up with any new ideas, Mastermind? I mean, Commander?
Px4Storm|FIX|Good grief... I'll need to find an excuse to deceive the insurance company.
Px4Storm|BREAK|I can't believe I messed up like this!
Px4Storm|SKILL2|To think I'd encounter them here...! I've got no choice!
Px4Storm|RETREAT|Since I've been exposed, choosing to fight some other day is hardly shameful.
Px4Storm|PHRASE|How much is this worth?
Type88|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year! Commander, were you planning to head outside for a stroll? ...May I come with you?
K31|DIALOGUE1|Usually when I'm bored, I'll go see what other people are doing, but it seems you're actually quite boring, Commander.
K31|DIALOGUE2|My breathing seems a bit out of sync with my internal clock... In...out...in... Hm, seems like it's alright now.
K31|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you've wasted quite a lot of my time already, so enjoy waiting for dinner tonight.
K31|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, both of us...should be ready for this, right? <>Was today's scenario orchestrated by you, or was it sheer coincidence? <>I don't know... but I understand that this moment was destined to occur...
K31|Introduce|Very good, this is just as planned. Meeting me now is the luckiest moment of your life, Commander.
K31|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, have you noticed any deviations in your biological clock recently? Don't worry, I'll help you adjust it.
P90|DIALOGUE1|Commander, do you know the latest slang nowadays? The memes change so fast that I can't keep up.
P90|DIALOGUE2|Just by changing my pitch a little, I can talk like this da nya~
P90|DIALOGUE3|"I-I'm not blushing! Don't get the wrong idea!" ...Hehe, is that what they call tsundere?
P90|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, do you want me to follow you forever?<>It's nothing tough for me as long as you don't mind me sticking so close to you...<>But you won't shake me off so easily, even if you run or fly away!
P90|Introduce|Huh? I was just following the other Dolls around... How did I end up here? ...Ah~ Hello! Do you know where this place is?
P90|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Everyone likes you, Commander, but my love for you isn't just a trend, you know? There's nothing quite like how I love you~
P90|CHRISTMAS|I feel sorry for people who dress up as Santa, because everyone's asleep when they're giving out presents and nobody will see what they look like.
TEC9|GAIN|I came here because I heard you could do work without coming into contact with humans... W-Wait a minute! Are you human?
TEC9|DIALOGUE1|When I think about how humans look just like Dolls but with all kinds of organs and blood inside them instead... Oh heavens, I'm losing my mind just thinking about it!
TEC9|DIALOGUE2|The "organization" where I previously worked had me using knives, but I ran away in the end because I couldn't do anything to the humans...
TEC9|DIALOGUE3|Commander, could you keep a safe distance from me? ...Yeah, at least ten meters.
TEC9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Th-This is so scary... I can't believe you have blood vessels in your eyes, Commander! Didn't I tell you to get some rest? You're making me very uncomfortable...
TEC9|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, to tell you the truth, I'm not really interested in humans... <>But you're a special case, because I get very concerned if you get hurt or if you get tired... <>Do you worry about me the same way too?
P22|DIALOGUE1|Like I was saying about the Commander's tactic... Hm? Is something the matter, Commander? Oh, I wasn't talking to you, don't mind me.
P22|DIALOGUE2|Commander, exactly how much do you know about yourself? We might be more alien to ourselves than we think.
P22|DIALOGUE3|Are you really so frustrated without a conversation partner? ...Alright then, what do you want to talk about?
P22|SOULCONTRACT|I think the Commander looks strange... What do you think? <>Mhm, he does look a little different, but I think I know what this is all about.<>However, the answer will have to wait until I put this on, okay? Hee hee~
P22|Introduce|Oh my, the Commander's come to pick me up, we'll talk another time. Greetings, Commander. My name is P22. Do you need help with anything?
P22|DIALOGUEWEDDING|When there's nothing we can talk about, I can always talk about you, Commander. Hehe, I'll never get tired of discussing about you, Commander. 
HS2000|DIALOGUE1|I like the sound of heartbeats... I envy those things which humans have, and which Dolls don't.
HS2000|DIALOGUE2|I only realized it after coming here, but it's not just medical science that can protect others. You can do that by picking up a weapon too.
HS2000|DIALOGUE3|Are you feeling unwell, Commander? Would you like me to shock you with my defibrillator?
HS2000|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, your heart seems to be beating faster than usual... <>Does this mean you're being sincere? A person's heart doesn't lie. <>Funny...I feel like...my heart's pounding too...
HS2000|Introduce|I see, so that's your heartbeat, Commander... Yes, I'll make sure to remember it. I'll be in your care from now on.
HS2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I remember your heartbeat in all kinds of situations, Commander - when you're working, when you're happy, when you're sleeping...but your heartbeat when you're happy sounds best.
HS2000|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas, Commander. Though there might be a sumptuous spread for dinner, please take care not to stuff yourself too much.
X95|DIALOGUE1|Flowers only have meaning when people appreciate them or when they wither away. Commander, I'm willing to endure any kind of suffering as long as I can bloom for everyone.
X95|DIALOGUE2|Jericho might be a little harsh, but I understand where her kindness lies... Commander, please place your trust in her.
X95|DIALOGUE3|Is there something bothering you? Take your time and tell me. I'm here for you. 
X95|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I've always worked hard for everyone and haven't thought much about myself... <>Yet you've accompanied me from the beginning and even shared my pain. <>Commander, you might be the only one who can save me...so please...become my final pillar of support.
X95|Introduce|This is wonderful, Commander, we meet at last. I, X95, will give everything I have for you... No, not just for you, for everyone.
X95|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, there's no need to bother you with such a small matter, right? I'll handle it by my... Ah// in that case, thank you for your kindness, hehe.
KSVK|DIALOGUE1|I will quietly await your orders here, Commander. Make your choice.
KSVK|DIALOGUE2|We stand in the center of the vortex of the world, Commander. Take care not to lose yourself in it.
KSVK|DIALOGUE3|I cannot answer all of your questions. Some answers can only be understood on your own.
KSVK|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I no longer see any confusion in your eyes. <>The time is ripe, and you are the sole truth within my heart... <>Oh oathsworn one, let us carve an eternal existence into each others' fates...
KSVK|Introduce|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!
KSVK|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Oh oathsworn one, cherish this present time, for this present happiness was not easily won, and I...can no longer bear to be without you.
UKM2000|DIALOGUE1|I escaped to this planet because of "them"... You don't need to know the details, Commander. It'll do you no good.
UKM2000|DIALOGUE2|Cats speak in a language that's very close to our mother tongue, so there are times when I can understand their thoughts.
UKM2000|DIALOGUE3|Don't pull down my hood! What if "they" recognize me...!
UKM2000|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, is this a good idea? I feel like I'm still keeping a lot of things from you... <>S-So you mean, you don't mind being with me, even if my planet invades the Earth? <>...Thank you, Commander... In that case, for the sake of this promise, I'm also willing to face any future with you!
UKM2000|Introduce|Are you...the Commander? It looks like I have no choice but to work with you from now on. "They" shouldn't be able to find me as long as I'm here...
UKM2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|A cat jumped out of nowhere in the dorms...it scared me half to death... Commander, if "they" find me, you'll have to protect me well.
scout|DIALOGUE1|A pet? How rude, Mitsuha is my...avian guardian...I guess?
scout|DIALOGUE2|Huh? When did they change the mission? ...Apologies, I was too focused on the documents during the meeting, and I guess I missed your announcement.
scout|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you mustn't take action before you understand what you're looking at.
scout|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I think I'm beginning to understand why Mitsuha likes you so much. <>I often find myself overlooking a lot of things because I keep looking at you because you keep drawing my attention when I least expect it... <>Will you keep looking at me too? Keep me in your eyes...and never look away.
scout|Introduce|Mitsuha, are you sure this is the one? ...What a surprise, I didn't expect someone to actually gain Mitsuha's approval. It looks like you're not an ordinary person, Commander.
scout|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, please don't stand beside me while I'm working, otherwise I'll only be able to think of you...b-but don't go too far away either.
Falcon|DIALOGUE1|I think I broke something again just now... Huh? What did you just say, Little Lamb...? A lack of talent? Haha, who are you talking about, dummy.
Falcon|DIALOGUE2|Well, it IS a musical instrument famous in my hometown. I can make a guitar like that too, and I can even teach you for free! ...Hmph, you're awfully lazy, Little Lamb. In that case, you can just watch me make it.
Falcon|DIALOGUE3|There sure are a lot of people from my hometown here... Personally, I'd prefer to lie on the grass and look at the sky by myself. But if it's you, Little Lamb, I'll let you lie beside me.
Falcon|SOULCONTRACT|Little Lamb, i-is that ring in your hand really for me? <>Why is it that you keep doing things that my instincts can't keep up with? It's so unfair... <>I love it! You'll always be the person I love most, Little Lamb...
Falcon|Introduce|Ahoj! Little Lamb...ah, no, I mean, Commander! It's a pleasure to meet you. You can call me Falcon.
Falcon|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Uwah! No peeking at the musical scores inside my drawer! They're all love songs I wrote for you... I'll play them for you when the anniversary comes, but it's too embarrassing to take them out now!
Falcon|NEWYEAR|Ooof, Little Lamb! There you are! It's full of people and exploding fireworks everywhere. Hide with me somewhere or I'd feel guilty for not visiting the others...
Magal|DIALOGUE1|I heard someone humming at the practice range. What? You mean you can't hear it, Commander? I'm sorry, it seems like I overestimated the extent of human hearing.
Magal|DIALOGUE2|You're asking about my headphones? They're used to filter out noise. I can't concentrate when my surroundings are too noisy...so please stop chattering on with useless things.
Magal|DIALOGUE3|Your hand feels very comfortable, and it puts me at ease...but that doesn't give you a reason to touch me at work.
Magal|SOULCONTRACT|It looks like you went out of your way to pick a quiet location. So, what do you want to tell me, Commander? <>...Is that so? How could I refuse someone who can discuss the world of touch and hearing with me? <>In that case, let's experience that world together. Thank you.
Magal|Introduce|Greetings, Commander. Your heartbeat sounds stable, which is a good thing.
Magal|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I can hear your heart beating, Commander. You don't need to approach me from the rear, by which I mean, hugging me from the front would be good too, right?
PM9|DIALOGUE1|Commander? Being picky about food isn't a good habit. Don't you think it's a little sad that you can't eat spicy stuff?
PM9|DIALOGUE2|I hear there are many Dolls on the base who are skilled in melee combat. I'd like to challenge them if possible. After all...there can only be one champion.
PM9|DIALOGUE3|C-Commander, you're too close... Hey, you can't just kabedon me - get lost! You're squashing my hair! Get lost!
PM9|SOULCONTRACT|Hah? Are you serious, Commander? <>Well...it's not like you can't... <>You're being unfair. From now on, I'm going to give you just as much of my feelings too.
PM9|Introduce|Huh, are you my new superior? Remember my name, I'm PM-9 submachine gun!
PM9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Huh? How come you've been able to catch my punches lately, Commander? Yet when I use the hand that's not wearing the ring, you can't catch them... Why is that?
Jill|DIALOGUE1|I told you before to call me Jill... Just Jill. I'll pour a Sugar Rush on your head if you dare call me by "that" name.
Jill|DIALOGUE2|Hey, Commander, want a drink? I think I should be able to mix something that'll cheer you up.
Jill|DIALOGUE3|Do you need some personal space, Fore? I don't mind staying here ~nya... Ahem, Commander, forget what you saw and heard just now... I was just practicing my ventriloquism, that's all.
Jill|SOULCONTRACT|W-Wait!? This is...for me?<>Trying to escape from your bar tab with this isn't funny at all... <>Alright alright, I get it. In any case...I still got a bar to run, you know, so start by topping up my fridge with beer.
Jill|Introduce|Hey, call me Jill, Boss... You know what, can I just call you Commander?
Jill|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Alright, enough with making me guess what sort of drinking game you want to play. Do you want to play truth or dare? I'll do anything besides petting a dog. ...Are you serious? "The person I like the most" is such an obvious question... Are you really going to waste a chance to get an honest answer out of me?
Jill|GAIN|Hey, call me Jill, Boss... You know what, can I just call you Commander?
SEI|DIALOGUE1|I long to help people, just as people have helped me. When I see you, Commander, I realize that there are others who like to stick their noses into things just like I do, which makes me very happy.
SEI|DIALOGUE2|The White Knights helmet is just too comfortable, to the point that I often forget it's still on my head... Have you had an experience like that before, Commander? Like looking for the glasses on your nose or a key that's already in the lock?
SEI|DIALOGUE3|Whether it's being a White Knight, Stella's bodyguard, or a Griffin employee...I haven't been able to get away from violent conflicts at all. Maybe this is my life.
SEI|SOULCONTRACT|Is this...uhm, is this for me? But, uhm, what will Stella think...?<>Aw, honestly... I'm just no good with this kind of thing. <>Commander, please consider this carefully. If you truly mean it, then I'll give you everything I have...
SEI|Introduce|Master Specialist, Sei P. Asagiri of the 765th Division Valkyrie Corps, at your service!
SEI|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Ever since that time, I keep recalling the embarrassing things you said to me every time I see you, Commander. Ah, but I was very happy to hear those words, of course! <>How shall I put this... I've always felt that I often say the wrong things by accident and make people upset... <>Yet, you're able to accept all of my faults and accomplish our goals together... I'm really happy that I met you.
SEI|GAIN|Master Specialist, Sei P. Asagiri of the 765th Division Valkyrie Corps, at your service!
Dorothy|DIALOGUE1|I'm pretty good at face reading. Let me guess, you've probably been through a lot, Commander. Yet, you still enjoy butting into other people's business, and so you'll wind up into even more trouble in the future... So, would you like Dorothy to comfort you? Hm?
Dorothy|DIALOGUE2|How do you feel about being called "Commander"? Addressing you as Senpai, Master, Babe, or Darling will cost you extra.
Dorothy|DIALOGUE3|What kind of role do you want me to play, Commander? Do you want me to act more innocent to match my appearance, or are you okay with me as I've always been?
Dorothy|SOULCONTRACT|Is this ring...for me? Commander, you...? This is making me feel like my heart has been infected by a Trojan virus... <>Pl-Please let me think about this... Dorothy belongs to everyone, after all, and if I become yours and yours only... <>Perhaps...that wouldn't be so bad. From now on, I will only provide my services to you.
Dorothy|Introduce|I'm Dorothy, the cutest of them all. Everybody needs me, and Dorothy belongs to everybody!
Dorothy|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Who am I? Why was I made? Are the feelings in my mind real, or are they simply ordinary electrical signals? All of my doubts are gone now. Did you really have to monopolize me, you greedy villain? Well then, come on!
Dorothy|GAIN|I'm Dorothy, the cutest of them all. Everybody needs me, and Dorothy belongs to everybody!
Stella|DIALOGUE1|I believe leaders are very important. A good leader can accomplish things with exceptional efficiency, but few people understand that. Many are only concerned with taking advantage of the situation without putting any effort in.
Stella|DIALOGUE2|These cat ears? They're not on my head because I want them to be, but I don't dislike them. I wouldn't mind if you want to try touching them... Wait, someone's coming!
Stella|DIALOGUE3|Sei is my most important friend...or maybe even more than just a friend. I believe that she'll be safe and happy working under you...or at the very least, she'll be happy.
Stella|SOULCONTRACT|This looks quite well made. So, who's the Lilim...I mean, the Tactical Doll you're forming an oath with? <>Me? You really do have a wild imagination, but I wouldn't say this is a bad idea.<>Then, let Sei and I accompany you along your path. Now, help me put it on.
Stella|Introduce|Stella Hoshii, that's my name. Alright, introductions are over. Now get me something to wake me up before we start work.
Stella|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is your work still not done yet? Well, it indeed has been a busy day, so I'll lend you a hand. In return, I get to dictate the rest of your free time.
Stella|GAIN|Stella Hoshii, that's my name. Alright, introductions are over. Now get me something to wake me up before we start work.
Alma|DIALOGUE1|The feeling of working here...is really quite novel. I don't usually meet my clients face to face, but since my client is the Commander of Griffin, and you're my most special client...
Alma|DIALOGUE2|Hey, where are you staring at? Commander? Comms Expander? Forget it, I don't care, but these aren't fake. I'm very proud of them, and why shouldn't I be? They're filled to the brim with love and dreams.
Alma|DIALOGUE3|You mean "those" photos? Have you forgotten that I'm a hacker? With a few simple keystrokes, your adorable sleeping face will be "accidentally" plastered all over Griffin Anonymous Message Board. Very well, I'll take an interesting story as your peace of mind fee.
Alma|SOULCONTRACT|Uhm, huh? This isn't a joke, is it?<>But if it's you, then maybe I... <>I'm terribly sorry for the hesitation. My answer is "yes", of course! I'd say that even if we weren't on the kiss cam!
Alma|Introduce|Greetings, Commander of Griffin, I am Alma. Hah, as I thought, I need to give a textbook self-introduction here too.
Alma|DIALOGUEWEDDING|It feels really good to have someone by my side... I think I understand you very well now, and the fact that I haven't broken up with you yet is really quite remarkable. Please continue to be my pillow. Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep if I don't hear your heartbeat.
Alma|GAIN|Greetings, Commander of Griffin, I am Alma. Hah, as I thought, I need to give a textbook self-introduction here too.
Dana|DIALOGUE1|Don't ask me about that sort of thing. I don't plan and evaluate every move I make.
Dana|DIALOGUE2|Are you free, Commander? I need some suggestions on how to get a blockage unstuck.
Dana|DIALOGUE3|You look like you need some more rest... Want a tender hug? Let me know if you want it, Commander. That's what friends are for.
Dana|SOULCONTRACT|Huh? So this is what you wanted to say after going around in circles for so long? <>Since you need me by your side, I'll have you become mine from now on. <>I'll take responsibility for protecting you, and I won't let you come to any harm. <>However, Jill won't be able to keep her head on straight once she learns of this, so make sure to buy her some expensive alcohol later.
Dana|Introduce|Just call me Dana, Commander. I don't quite understand your work, but let me know if I can help out in any way.
Dana|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Want to see the world once you're less busy? There are a few places on Earth that you shouldn't visit alone, like Iceland, Finland, or Panama... Which do you think should be our first stop?
Dana|GAIN|Just call me Dana, Commander. I don't quite understand your work, but let me know if I can help out in any way.
ASVALMod|SOULCONTRACT|Huh? You...me...? My bear... Uh, no... Nothing!<>In any case, thank you so much for your acknowledgment! I'll try my best to live up to your expectations, Commander!
ASVALMod|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween...isn't really my thing...
G36Mod|SOULCONTRACT|I have only been able to give my all because you need me, Master.<>From now on, please let me stay by your side as your bespoke maid.
G36Mod|Introduce|Guten tag. I will exclusively serve as your maid from now on, master.
G36Mod|ALLHALLOWS|Commander, you shouldn't spoil everyone so much. You've given out too much candy tonight. They might not be able to go into battle if they get cavities.
G36Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|It's going to be another busy day today, yet you're the only one that knows how hardworking I am... So, is there anything you'd like me to get for you? I'll continue to keep this a secret from everyone.
LWMMGMod|SOULCONTRACT|Is this...prepared for me? Isn't this a bit too extravagant?<>...But I'll let you have your way this time.<>I've occasionally fantasized about this scenario before, but I've never thought it would become reality...<>I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart, Commander...
LWMMGMod|Introduce|Pleased to meet you, Commander. There is...no need to introduce me to the others. I'm fine working alone...
LWMMGMod|ALLHALLOWS|I didn't expect Halloween to be this busy. Everyone! You'd better not throw out the packaging for the candies! You can reuse them for many other purposes!
LWMMGMod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I booked us dinner at a good restaurant this weekend. You've worked hard this week, so I'll splurge a little on you.
LWMMGMod|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. The finance report for the previous year is out. There wasn't too much wastage, so please keep up the good work for this year.
M14Mod|SOULCONTRACT|This day is finally here, Commander.<>I've always wondered when you would notice me...<>This is the happiest of my entire life!
M14Mod|Introduce|Commander, I will not let you down!
M14Mod|ALLHALLOWS|It's a trick for you~ Heheh! ...You'd have been fine if you had given me candy.
M14Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|So sleepy... You should let us have a little more sleep, Commander! The logistic operations are so exhausting... Yes, yes, that's a present for you... Hey! Wait! You can't open it now! Give that back to us!
M14Mod|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas! Santa Claus is coming, right? RIGHT?
MicroUZIMod|SOULCONTRACT|Why did you give me something like this out of nowhere! Idiot, don't make me shoot you!<>I... This sort of thing...<>Alright, I don't particularly dislike you, so I'll look after you...
StenMK2Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Eh? My feelings...are answered?<>For someone like me without any strong points, I thought that this day would never come.<>It's the first time I've felt so happy.
StenMK2Mod|Introduce|You are the rumored Commander, right? Nice to meet you.
StenMK2Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, don't go to the cafeteria after work today. I've prepared some desserts for you... Hehe, I have to show off my skills once in a while!
STG44Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Eh! Commander, why are you so close?<>Uh, I don't dislike you, but...what...?! Really?! I've always been bothering you so much...<>Then...can I scoot a little closer to you?
STG44Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, even if you have a lot of work, don't slack on your appearance! Come, let me fix you up.
K31|GAIN|Very good, this is just as planned. Meeting me now is the luckiest moment of your life, Commander.
P90|GAIN|Huh? I was just following the other Dolls around... How did I end up here? ...Ah~ Hello! Do you know where this place is?
TEC9|Introduce|I came here because I heard you could do work without coming into contact with humans... W-Wait a minute! Are you human?
P22|GAIN|Oh my, the Commander's come to pick me up, we'll talk another time. Greetings, Commander. My name is P22. Do you need help with anything?
HS2000|GAIN|I see, so that's your heartbeat, Commander... Yes, I'll make sure to remember it. I'll be in your care from now on.
X95|GAIN|This is wonderful, Commander, we meet at last. I, X95, will give everything I have for you... No, not just for you, for everyone.
KSVK|GAIN|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!
UKM2000|GAIN|Are you...the Commander? It looks like I have no choice but to work with you from now on. "They" shouldn't be able to find me as long as I'm here...
scout|GAIN|Mitsuha, are you sure this is the one? ...What a surprise, I didn't expect someone to actually gain Mitsuha's approval. It looks like you're not an ordinary person, Commander.
Falcon|GAIN|Ahoj! Little Lamb...ah, no, I mean, Commander! It's a pleasure to meet you. You can call me Falcon.
Magal|GAIN|Greetings, Commander. Your heartbeat sounds stable, which is a good thing.
PM9|GAIN|Huh, are you my new superior? Remember my name, I'm PM-9 submachine gun!
K11_0|Introduce|Guess who this is, Commander of Griffin! I'm K11, an expert at handling emergencies. Please let me show you my full potential!
K11_0|GAIN|Guess who this is, Commander of Griffin! I'm K11, an expert at handling emergencies. Please let me show you my full potential!
UMP45_0|Introduce|UMP45 has arrived. Commander, let's get along from now on~
UMP45_0|GAIN|UMP45 has arrived. Commander, let's get along from now on~
UMP9_0|Introduce|UMP9 has come home! Everybody, we're family now!
UMP9_0|GAIN|UMP9 has come home! Everybody, we're family now!
KSVK_0|Introduce|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!
KSVK_0|GAIN|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!
OC44_0|Introduce|I finally get to meet you, Commander!~ I'm OTs-44, may I stay here with you?
OC44_0|GAIN|I finally get to meet you, Commander!~ I'm OTs-44, may I stay here with you?
HK416_0|HELLO|Good morning, Commander. I won't lose to anyone today.
AK12|HELLO|I can tell it's you without having to look, Commander.
AN94|HELLO|I'm on standby for your instructions, Commander.
ASVALMod|DIALOGUE1|Have you noticed I'm more diligent than before? I just think that since I've become more powerful, I should work even harder.
ASVALMod|DIALOGUE2|I always feel like...my bear is too noisy, although I asked for this feature in the first place. I'm regretting it a little.
ASVALMod|DIALOGUE3|Have you seen 9A-91 and AK-74U? That's strange, they were just here...
ASVALMod|Introduce|I will no longer regret the past, Commander. From now on it will no longer be only myself, but my bear as well will be putting forth the effort into our performance.
ASVALMod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You want to speak to me...? Eh? W-Wait a minute, let me put my bear away first... I can't let him hear you! There are some things that I can't share even if he's my friend! It's too embarrassing!
ASVALMod|NEWYEAR|Um...to be honest, I don't really enjoy this festival. It's great to have a holiday, but I don't like all the hubbub very much.
K2|SKILL3|I've got the upper hand now!
K2|GOATTACK|The mission has started, everyone!
K2|FIX|Will K5 look down on me if she sees me like this...?
K2|BREAK|If the juniors see me like this...!
K2|DEFENSE|Don't be too rash.
K2|HELLO|Make sure to take good notice of my performance today.
MicroUZIMod|DIALOGUE1|I finished the assigned work. Do you have anything else for me?
MicroUZIMod|DIALOGUE2|Despite rushing through the work, I think I completed it correctly... The incident report should be filed properly too...
MicroUZIMod|DIALOGUE3|Wait! These aren't what got upgraded... Don't touch them!
MicroUZIMod|Introduce|Quit spacing out. I didn't go through this upgrade just for you to stare at! Just leave your work to me!
MicroUZIMod|ALLHALLOWS|Candy! Candy! I'll play a trick on you if you don't give me candy within three seconds!
MicroUZIMod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I admit I was a little nervous earlier, but some things aren't meant to be said in front of everyone... But maybe later tonight when the others aren't around...
STG44Mod|DIALOGUE1|What is it? I'm very busy, so your order best be shortened to three sentences.
STG44Mod|DIALOGUE2|This spot is very delicate. Please exercise caution when you touch it!
STG44Mod|DIALOGUE3|If you have something to bring up, can you do it later? Also, please wash your hands first.
STG44Mod|Introduce|Commander, how do I look now? Yes...let's shake hands this time.
STG44Mod|ALLHALLOWS|I'll pass on wearing those dirty-looking clothes... Eh? Halloween? Ooh, so that's what it is.
MG36|DIALOGUE1|Hm? My hopes for the future? Don't think you'll get that out of me. And my past... Just consider it as a mystery.
MG36|DIALOGUE2|If possible, I'd like to do some movie-related work after I get discharged. Expressing your thoughts with images is always easier than with words.
MG36|DIALOGUE3|Is she here too? No wonder you got me confused with her. No, I'm happy she's here and that I remind you of her...
MG36|SOULCONTRACT|Are you really sure about this? To add this line onto my curriculum vitae...<>You already knew how I would react, didn't you? When you say those words...<>..."I know" would be my reply.
MG36|Introduce|Gr MG36, reporting for duty. A new base, huh... I hope you're not the type to pry into their subordinate's past, Commander.
MG36|DIALOGUEWEDDING|R-Really? You're really willing to watch that century-old sci-fi movie with me? ...Well, since your work is complete, I'll especially allow you to sit beside me... But you're not allowed to make any noise.
ChauchatM1915|DIALOGUE1|Hm? I'm performing maintenance on my weapon right now. Come talk to me later if you need something.
ChauchatM1915|DIALOGUE2|Have you seen my waist bag, Commander? I haven't been able to find it since my last mission...
ChauchatM1915|DIALOGUE3|This is very odd, Commander. How come it's always you finding my lost things? Don't tell me you're the one stealing them.
ChauchatM1915|SOULCONTRACT|Commander...you're really willing to care for an unreliable thing like me?<>Then I must work hard to improve myself, both in combat and as your...<>From now on, I will fix my own faults along with yours, Commander!
ChauchatM1915|Introduce|Are you the commander here? Then, Chauchat M1915, reporting for duty.
ChauchatM1915|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, have you eaten breakfast? Do you have your equipment with you? Is your work completely finished? Don't grumble now. Everything should be checked in advance...because it'll be too late for regret if something were to interrupt our time together.
EM2|DIALOGUE1|1, 2, 3...58...60. Ah, found it. Commander, here are the "60 minus 1" files you wanted. Sorry for saying it this way, but I must avoid that demonic number.
EM2|DIALOGUE2|Want to take a break with some tea, Commander? I've prepared some delicious biscuits too.
EM2|DIALOGUE3|Erm...you're asking me why I'm not confident in my deduction? Because there are too many variables in this world... It's simply impossible to predict all the possibilities.
EM2|SOULCONTRACT|W-What? ...I didn't expect you to pick me.<>Ahaha... Although I don't have much confidence in myself, as long as you're here...I won't be afraid anymore even if I have to face that demonic number.<>Please take good care of me from now on.
EM2|Introduce|Hello, Commander. EM-2 assault rifle is joining your ranks today. Mhm...judging by your reaction, my self-introduction has left you with a good impression.
EM2|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I'm sure you'll love the biscuits today. I baked them myself. Ahaha...it's all thanks to you that I'm so confident now.
PA15|DIALOGUE1|You didn't look like the sort to have this kind of hobby, Commander. Although it's not a bad thing to be so straightforward about seeking excitement.
PA15|DIALOGUE2|Wow! You surprised me with that move. Awesome!
PA15|DIALOGUE3|Do any Griffin Dolls get their fill of satisfaction from being broken? I'd like to give that a try.
PA15|SOULCONTRACT|Ah, Commander, you're here.<>Huhu, are you here to swear an oath with me?<>What's with that expression? I can tell your thoughts with just one look.<>Then, shall we?
PA15|Introduce|Hello, Commander! PA-15 reporting. You will assign me the most exciting missions, right?
PA15|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Thanks for the hard work today. Want to have some fun at a night themed amusement park after work? Or do you want to quietly relax with a drink somewhere?
R93|DIALOGUE1|Darn...I almost won this week's lottery. How unfortunate. Will you help me pick the numbers next time, Commander?
R93|DIALOGUE2|I heard luck is also a part of strength. Then...am I strong or am I weak...?
R93|DIALOGUE3|I always have the hunch that my luck will become better and better if I'm with you. Commander, I'll be counting on you to bring me good luck today.
R93|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, are you really choosing me?<>I never imagined that I would come across such good luck outside the battlefield. All the good fortune I saved up probably just got used up.<>But if I can be by your side, then who cares about that bit of luck? Thank you...Commander. I will fight for you with not only my luck, but with everything I have.
R93|Introduce|Hello, Commander. R93 reporting for duty! Hehe, complete victory is guaranteed when I'm involved! Wanna bet...if you don't believe me?
R93|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Ever since staying by your side, I have been able to do many things without having to rely on luck. But I think perhaps this is the ultimate good luck I receive from being with you.
R93|MEET|Whoever faces me must have terrible luck.
R93|BREAK|Ahaha...sorry, my luck isn't so good this time.
R93|FIX|Sorry, Commander... Consider this time to be charging up luck...
R93|PHRASE|Want to make a bet?
R93|ATTACK|A new round has begun! I'll be winning this time!
R93|RETREAT|I actually lost? Darn...let's have another go.
R93|HELLO|How's your luck today?
HK33|DIALOGUE1|I'm on a mission right now, so please don't talk to me, otherwise I'll get distracted.
HK33|DIALOGUE2|Commander, could you step back a little? It's nothing personal, but I'd prefer to keep a safe distance of at least three meters from unfamiliar people.
HK33|DIALOGUE3|P-Please don't sneak up on me, Commander! You scared me to heck!
HK33|SOULCONTRACT|Is this...for me? ...I didn't expect to get hit by friendly fire.<>Now that I think about it, it's only when I'm with you that I can be so at ease.<>Perhaps this is what I've been seeking all along... I'll be leaving my six to you, Commander, so you'll have to cover my back from now on.
HK33|Introduce|Gr HK33, reporting to Griffin. Um...Commander, you don't look like an ally...with that expression of yours.
HK33|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Who's sneaking behind my back... Oh, it's you, Commander.
MP41|DIALOGUE1|Am RFB is playing video games on duty again. Should her pay be docked or should she be put into solitary confinement, Commander?
MP41|DIALOGUE2|This won't do, Miss Kalina. Watching your drama shows on the clock? If the Commander finds out, uhuhu...
MP41|DIALOGUE3|Impossible... Why can't I find MP40's weak point?! No, as long as I keep up my surveillance, I'll catch her slipping one day!
MP41|SOULCONTRACT|Huh, Commander? What are you doing? Ah...<>I've worked so hard for this day to come, and now...<>No, I can't cry! To be chosen by Dear Commander is of the utmost honor! I'm truly very happy...<>You have always been the most special human to me, Dear Commander. Am I now the most special Doll to you?
MP41|Introduce|Greetings, Dear Commander! I have long admired you, and it is my greatest honor to serve you!
MP41|DIALOGUEWEDDING|...Snitching? Slandering? Bad-mouthing? I haven't done any of that! Dear Commander you should know best, I'm your most loyal employee! Everything I do is to help you get rid of the parasites in our company!
TCMS|DIALOGUE1|I don't dislike children... It's just that I don't know why they keep picking on me... Uuu...
TCMS|DIALOGUE2|Hey, want to go hiking with me next weekend? If you want to know the reason, it's perhaps because...I don't feel so small when I'm at the peak. When you're looking down from the top, everything else becomes smaller.
TCMS|DIALOGUE3|Mhm, I know there's another T-Doll here with the same name as me... But she looks like a child, so I'm a little scared... I wonder if we can be friends...
TCMS|SOULCONTRACT|Oh? Can someone like me really accept this gift?<>Thank you very much... Thank you for your kindness and your constant watch over me...<>Although I have a soft voice...I will answer you with all of my heart...!
TCMS|Introduce|T-CMS, reporting for duty... Um, Commander, I said reporting for duty... Did you hear me...?
TCMS|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Com—man—der—! You can't snack on those high calorie snacks anymore! Q-Quit using the poor excuse of not hearing me! Goodness, I'll really get angry! Your punishment will be to camp on top of the mountain with me this weekend... Yes, just the two of us...
K11_0|DIALOGUE1|Commander, I've developed a new energy drink. You want a taste? Drink it like this and you'll be full of energy! ...Glug glug glug... Pwahh!
K11_0|DIALOGUE2|This is the standard dress code for a researcher, right? I want to be an outstanding researcher in the future. So outstanding that I'll stylishly make the crowds go wild! But, uh, before that, I must fix my weapon's issue...
K11_0|DIALOGUE3|Don't worry, Commander, you can keep walking at your own pace. I'll keep up with this modded auto-chair of mine... Uwaaaahhh!!
K11_0|SOULCONTRACT|Hey hey, got something new for me to research? ...You're hopeless. Give it here.<>Is this sort of thing really research? No matter how you look at it, it's the sort of thing that you decide on when you grow up, right?<>But I'll accept this gift now... I believe that even when I grow up, I will not regret this decision.
K11_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|My classmates in the past always thought of me as a loner, but that's because I didn't want to explain things to idiots. But you're different, Commander. You don't see me the same way as they did....so I will do my best for you.
UMP45_0|DIALOGUE1|Nose? Hm? What are you looking at, Commander? Did some of the desserts stick to my nose?
UMP45_0|DIALOGUE2|Stop always chatting me up. I need some time for my own thoughts...like how to tease you, for example.
UMP45_0|DIALOGUE3|You're such a bumbler, Commander. Jeez, adults are supposed to have good sense and self-control. Don't think you'll get me with this bunch of toys here! I...I like the bunny! Gimme!
UMP45_0|SOULCONTRACT|Ehhh??! You'd still want me to stay here even though I look like this?<>Tch, you're not a new toy, it's not like I'm happy or anything...<>Fine, then I'll take up the burden of guiding you into becoming an outstanding adult!
UMP45_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I'm not a kid! Don't give me candy! Eh? T-Then you're giving it all to 9? ...I don't want the candy at all!
UMP9_0|DIALOGUE1|Commander look! 45's dress fans out when she spins around! I want to wear a dress too!
UMP9_0|DIALOGUE2|Are you awake, Commander? Commander, are you still awake? ...45 said I could draw on your face after you fall asleep... Uh, wait! She said I can't say she said that!
UMP9_0|DIALOGUE3|Huh? It's childish to wear my doggie backpack outside? But I am a child. The adult world is too troublesome; I don't want to grow up at all.
UMP9_0|SOULCONTRACT|Uwah! This is a lot more expensive than a toy...<>Then...you and 45 will both be looking after me!<>Remember to make me breakfast every day! Eh? Of course, it's only to be expected that you take care of the little sister, hehe~
UMP9_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander Commander, want to play trains? I'll be the engine! Eh? You don't want to play? You're no fun, Commander... Fine, then you be the engine!
KSVK_0|DIALOGUE1|The endurance of my mind has nothing to do with the size of my body. Even as a child... Uuug...I can't write any more...
KSVK_0|DIALOGUE2|I don't care anymore! How can there be so many principles in this world? Why can't it be simpler?!
KSVK_0|DIALOGUE3|Commander look! I've finished my painting! ...Eh? The meaning behind it? Why is something like that necessary?
KSVK_0|SOULCONTRACT|I've never noticed before...that some things are easier to figure out when you're a child...<>The stuff that adults say they like or are beautiful do not, in fact, require any reason or external expression for liking them.<>However, even if words are unneeded, some feelings must be communicated through actions... Wouldn't you agree, Commander?
KSVK_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander! I came up with a quote that'll sure to become famous when I was watching you sleep yesterday! Wanna hear it?
OC44_0|DIALOGUE1|Commander! Want me to play with me? Piggy will play too!
OC44_0|DIALOGUE2|Commander, do you need anything? Ms. Kalina said children aren't allowed to touch alcohol, but I can still brew you tea!
OC44_0|DIALOGUE3|Angry? Why would I be angry? I like everybody at Griffin, and I love hugging Piggy... And being able to play with you, I'm super happy!
OC44_0|SOULCONTRACT|Wow...to encounter such a blissful moment this early...<>I must be the luckiest T-Doll in the world.<>In order to help you with many things, I will do my best to grow up quickly!<>When I'm all grown up, whether it is the tea making or the wine pouring, you can leave it all to me!
OC44_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Do you want to play today, Commander? I won't bring Piggy along this time so you can't say I'm cheating! I'll beat you fair and square, so prepare a reward for me~
HK416_0|DIALOGUE1|Commander, you'll be by my side forever...right?
HK416_0|DIALOGUE2|Adults always have endless expectations for the new things around them...yet I don't have a choice.
HK416_0|DIALOGUE3|Commander...although my current name is 416...I'd still be happy if you were to call me HKM4.
HK416_0|SOULCONTRACT|To do this sort of thing... Have you already mentally prepared yourself?<>If I lose my name again someday in the future...you wouldn't feel regretful, right?<>I'm very afraid that I wouldn't be able to handle it if that were to happen...but I believe in your decision...<>Because I am 416...the one that loves you the most, Commander!
HK416_0|Introduce|Are you the Commander? 416... Please remember this name.
HK416_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Are you enjoying our time together, Commander? Although I still don't know what to do when I'm unhappy...I'm sure that as long as we work together, we'll definitely overcome any obstacle!
HK416_0|WIN|Humph, this is what you get!
HK416_0|PHRASE|Watch me.
HK416_0|BREAK|I must become even more perfect...
HK416_0|RETREAT|...If only I were more perfect...then something like wouldn't have happened...
HK416_0|FEED|One step at a time...until I can proudly say my name.
HK416_0|SKILL1|I'll do my best!
HK416_0|SKILL3|Don't think you can bully me that easily!
ADS|DIALOGUE1|Can't I swim today? Ack, no underwater mission? Jeez, I wanted to show you how awesome I am.
ADS|DIALOGUE2|I can't keep up with the latest fashion... What are you doing here, Commander?! ...What, can't I look at these? My age... What does it have to do with my age?!
ADS|DIALOGUE3|O-Of course I have friends! What sort of baseless rumors are you paying attention to? Well...it is true that only SPP-1 and I know how to swim, and the others don't like to play in the water with me... Aww, don't worry about it, Commander! I'm sure I'll make some more new friends soon!
ADS|SOULCONTRACT|What are you up to sitting beside me all of a sudden? Eat this water attack!<>Eh ehhh? S-Sorry...I didn't see the ring in your hand...<>Alright, I got it out of the pool...but now we're both drenched. Hehe, you'll have to practice your swimming if you want to be with me, Commander.
ADS|Introduce|My name is ADS amphibious assault rifle, got it? Don't forget to let me take the lead whether on land or underwater, Commander!
ADS|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What do you want to do today, Commander? A drive by the beach? Or would you like to stay home and cook together? I just got a new cookbook, so I gotta put some practice in! Once we move to a bigger house, the kitchen can become my new battlefield!
P30|DIALOGUE1|Don't underestimate me, Commander. No matter what you do, I'll remember every single detail of it.
P30|DIALOGUE2|The most important attribute of an adjutant is to have exceptional memory, so you've got a good eye for picking me, Commander. I won't lose to anyone when it comes to that!
P30|DIALOGUE3|There are many troublemakers here too, but no matter, because I'll get my revenge...one...by...one. You think I'm intimidating...? Wait, you're taking it the wrong way! It's not like I can't forgive you if you take me out to eat or give me a present...
P30|SOULCONTRACT|The scenery here is very beautiful, Commander.<>Um...giving me this, and asking me such a question... Is this real? I'll never forget this moment...<>I accept, Commander. Let today be a memory that we will never forget.
P30|Introduce|Gr P30, reporting! Alright, I've remembered your face now, Commander~
P30|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Let's create some wonderful memories today as well, Commander. Because then, you can reminisce about me if I were to not be with you anymore one day...but know that I won't willingly give you up to anyone else!
4type|DIALOGUE1|If there is any work I can do for you, please let me know, Master...I mean, Commander.
4type|DIALOGUE2|The deadline is almost... I won't make it at this pace... Ah, it's nothing, Commander! I didn't say anything!
4type|DIALOGUE3|...You found a shoujo manga on the internet by an anonymous author and you're the protagonist of the story? I-I'm not sure what you're talking about. You're so funny, Commander.
4type|SOULCONTRACT|...For me? W-Wait, am I dreaming?<>I must be dreaming in a manga confession scene right now. I'd better wake up... Ouch! So I'm not dreaming at all...<>Commander...I will do everything in my power to repay you for holding me in such high regards!
4type|Introduce|4 Shiki automatic rifle greets you. Please give the order if you require anything of me!
4type|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You're really getting the hang of coloring and shading, Commander. I think you can become a great assistant one day! However, the most important thing right now is to have you be my first reader... So, what do you think of this chapter?
4type|NEWYEAR|Oh, Commander? Making New Year visits? Sure. I've been rushing deadlines- I mean, I've been training so hard...I feel rather burned out. Going out in the first month of the year and immersing in the auspicious air might just give me some inspiration.
4type|CHRISTMAS|Thunder Claws... Must we extend a welcome to such an ominous-sounding individual? We feel this occasion is by no means a happy one.
K3|DIALOGUE1|I was once the training partner of professional athletes and watched them diligently train to achieve results in sports competitions. I used to envy those athletes...but I am now very satisfied with my life, because you're here to guide my training, Commander!
K3|DIALOGUE2|Ah! Where did you come from, Commander! What's behind my back...? A broken vase? A broom snapped in half? What are you talking about? I have nothing behind my back!
K3|DIALOGUE3|Perseverance is a very important trait for an athlete. I believe it is very important for you as well, Commander! So...please continue to have me as your adjutant, and I will continue to give it my all!
K3|SOULCONTRACT|Eh? Is this...an award for me, Commander?<>I used to think that receiving your approval was as hard as achieving a top 3 ranking in a sports competition, and I never would've imagined that I'd be able to do something I've always dreamt of...<>I will always remember the glory that you have bestowed upon me, Commander. Even if my neural cloud gets destroyed, I will never forget this day!
K3|Introduce|Report, K3 has successfully reached the destination! Please assign me the next training mission, Commander!
K3|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Can I prepare the training schedule today, Commander? I'm not gonna add anything strange to it! I just want to stay beside you... Not to mention, this is my favorite type of training...
HK416Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Be it you or achievements in combat, everything is mine.<>You don't have to raise a finger, Commander. I'll settle everything for you.
MP5Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Ah, Commander? Is this...really for me?!<>For someone like me who is insignificant in everything, can I really stay by your side? ......Yes, I will!
UMP9Mod|SOULCONTRACT|This warm feeling...<>Is this the feeling of "love"?<>With this, we can finally become a real family...
4type|GAIN|4 Shiki automatic rifle greets you. Please give the order if you require anything of me!
ASVALMod|GAIN|I will no longer regret the past, Commander. From now on it will no longer be only myself, but my bear as well will be putting forth the effort into our performance.
MicroUZIMod|GAIN|Quit spacing out. I didn't go through this upgrade just for you to stare at! Just leave your work to me!
STG44Mod|GAIN|Commander, how do I look now? Yes...let's shake hands this time.
MG36|GAIN|Gr MG36, reporting for duty. A new base, huh... I hope you're not the type to pry into their subordinate's past, Commander.
ChauchatM1915|GAIN|Are you the commander here? Then, Chauchat M1915, reporting for duty.
EM2|GAIN|Hello, Commander. EM-2 assault rifle is joining your ranks today. Mhm...judging by your reaction, my self-introduction has left you with a good impression.
PA15|GAIN|Hello, Commander! PA-15 reporting. You will assign me the most exciting missions, right?
R93|GAIN|Hello, Commander. R93 reporting for duty! Hehe, complete victory is guaranteed when I'm involved! Wanna bet...if you don't believe me?
HK33|GAIN|Gr HK33, reporting to Griffin. Um...Commander, you don't look like an ally...with that expression of yours.
MP41|GAIN|Greetings, Dear Commander! I have long admired you, and it is my greatest honor to serve you!
TCMS|GAIN|T-CMS, reporting for duty... Um, Commander, I said reporting for duty... Did you hear me...?
HK416_0|GAIN|Are you the Commander? 416... Please remember this name.
ADS|GAIN|My name is ADS amphibious assault rifle, got it? Don't forget to let me take the lead whether on land or underwater, Commander!
P30|GAIN|P30, reporting! Alright, I've remembered your face now, Commander~
K3|GAIN|Report, K3 has successfully reached the destination! Please assign me the next training mission, Commander!
97typeS|ALLHALLOWS|These days...even the lanterns look forlorn. This Halloween is more straightforward than our Ghost Festival...
HK416Mod|DIALOGUE1|Is that you, Commander? Perfect timing. Now you can see for yourself the power of a true T-Doll.
HK416Mod|DIALOGUE2|I don't mind helping weaker T-Dolls. That's the responsibility of the strong. But if they keep getting in the way of my work...I'll have to teach them a lesson.
HK416Mod|DIALOGUE3|Relax, Commander. I'm here, so nothing is too big a problem.
HK416Mod|Introduce|How am I different than before? Not too different. After all, scoring more than full marks is still full marks.
HK416Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|If you ever lose interest in me, Commander, feel free to have me replaced. However, I believe even you know full well you won't find a better choice than me.
M1903|PHRASE|Heheh ♪, my pleasure.
M1903|HELLO|Heheh, good morning.
MP5Mod|DIALOGUE1|I look cooler with a cape, don't I? Heheh, I'm a seasoned warrior, after all, and a warrior should own a cape.
MP5Mod|DIALOGUE2|Oh, milk for my breakfast? Danke, Commander...though I'm not sure if I still need it now.
MP5Mod|DIALOGUE3|Fighting...has always been pointless, right? But you can't protect what you want to protect unless you fight...
MP5Mod|Introduce|I'm no longer a child, alright? That's why, Commander, you can fully rely on me.
MP5Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Huhhh?! How did you get this...? I even climbed a step ladder just to hide it on top of the bookcase... What?! What's so funny about preparing your birthday present beforehand?! Sheesh, you do the housework today!
PSG1|ALLHALLOWS|I prefer quiet places, but it's not so bad being in the hubbub like this every once in a while.
UMP9Mod|DIALOGUE1|I don't know what you think about family, Commander...but I believe our mission to protect them will never change!
UMP9Mod|DIALOGUE2|Heheh, I can tell it isn't 45 just from the footsteps. But running into you...makes me quite happy.
UMP9Mod|DIALOGUE3|We've done a lot...but is it really enough?
UMP9Mod|Introduce|I'm back, Commander! As a family, we won't get torn apart so easily!
UMP9Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Hmm? You don't have to think too much about what to say. After all...we can all tell what each other is thinking in this big family.
CETME556|ALLHALLOWS|T-Dolls or monsters, their playful nature never changes.
M870P|ALLHALLOWS|I haven't prepared these candy for nothing, you brats. You gotta trade soda for your happiness!
KSVK|ALLHALLOWS|Perhaps no soul could find their way back before daybreak.
PA15|PHRASE|Yo, what's so interesting?
PA15|OPERATIONBEGIN|Then I'm heading off to play! Just kidding. Salut, Commander.
PA15|HELLO|Ahhhh, here it comes, here it comes! Something interesting is happening!
PA15|RETREAT|I didn't measure up. I'll do better next time... Désolée, Commander.
PA15|BREAK|Ack, so this is what failure feels like... It's surprisingly not too bad.
PA15|FIX|Haha...that tickles! Now do it on this side!
PA15|DEFENSE|En garde.
PA15|OPERATIONOVER|I'm back with some cool souvenirs.
DesertEagle|DIALOGUE1|I've left the stage in the past. If I could ever go back... Nevermind, better not think about such things. Right now, my only goal is to become an outstanding T-Doll.
DesertEagle|DIALOGUE2|You want to watch me perform? I'm playing your adjutant now, aren't I? What, is that not enough? Hmm, then why don't I demonstrate a classic scene in any action movie - tearing up a room in no time? Pfft...what a hilarious face you made. Sadly, I was just kidding.
DesertEagle|DIALOGUE3|You look bored. Wanna make a bet? If I can lift you together with your chair, you owe me a movie date. Deal?
DesertEagle|SOULCONTRACT|Are you sure you want to give this to me? ...Commander, thank you so much. <>I'd always thought the stage was where I truly belonged, but now...there's another place for me. <>Coming here was the best choice I've ever made... From now on, please accept my most genuine feelings.
DesertEagle|Introduce|Producer...no, I should call you "Commander", shouldn't I? Hello, I'm Desert Eagle, and I'll be joining your crew. Let's get along from now on.
DesertEagle|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You're wondering about today's schedule...? The only thing on your schedule is to relax with me. I've planned the whole holiday, so let us spend a wonderful day together, Commander.
SSG3000|DIALOGUE1|Commander, do you know that apart from shooting skills, patience and timing are equally important for a sniper?
SSG3000|DIALOGUE2|Observing your target is really fun. Sometimes gazing at the enemy is even more fun than pulling the trigger at them.
SSG3000|DIALOGUE3|Should we go camping one of these days, Commander? It'd be nice to spend a few days out in the wild every now and then.
SSG3000|SOULCONTRACT|Uh...what's this? I've imagined this many times in my neural cloud, but I didn't know how it'd make me feel... <>To be honest, I've been waiting for this a long time, Commander. <>I'm curious about one thing - when did my bullet pierce your heart? I really want to know the answer.
SSG3000|Introduce|SSG 3000 has arrived at the destination. Awaiting your orders, Commander.
SSG3000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Staaaaaare... Oh, you caught me, Commander. I can't seem to hide my presence these days, or have you grown more astute? <>I feel content just watching you and not doing anything sometimes... <>What, you want to take a good look at me too? Heheheh...suit yourself.
ACR|DIALOGUE1|What is it, Commander? A new job? Awesome, I'll go right away... Nothing, I was just worried you came to tell me I've been transferred.
ACR|DIALOGUE2|Don't worry, my system won't wipe any data concerning my work. Hmm...since you're also part of work, I don't think I'll forget you either...
ACR|DIALOGUE3|There's no point getting angry over them. They have no place in your world anyway. Those who always rage mindlessly will never excel.
ACR|SOULCONTRACT|...You sure you didn't put down the wrong name on your memo? <>Is it wise to give this to me? My neural cloud keeps deleting those happy memories... <>You alone...you're the only one I absolutely don't want to forget, but can I do it...?
ACR|Introduce|Bushmaster ACR reporting for duty. I'll jot down everything carefully.
ACR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Perhaps losing some short-term memory isn't so bad. I'll just think of it as fast-forwarding in time... Hmm? That's not what I meant. It's just that...one second you're smiling at me, the next second I have a bouquet in my hands. Ha, isn't it like magic? Not to mention...it's a spell you cast on me.
M1895MG|DIALOGUE1|Commander, I've cleaned up your office. All discarded documents are in this box. Would you like to double check them? Ah...I can just destroy them? Right away.
M1895MG|DIALOGUE2|Do you think this backpack is too big? ...Apart from my own equipment, I'm also carrying everyone's gear. It looks heavy? ...It's fine, I can handle it.
M1895MG|DIALOGUE3|Any small knick-knacks I like? Buying things that can only be gawked at is completely unnecessary. But I won't mind having a nice pen holder or something on the desk.
M1895MG|SOULCONTRACT|Well...are you absolutely sure you want to give this to me? <>No matter how much I've prepared myself, I never expected this day would come... Do you like pulling sneak attacks like this? Jeez... <>Thank you for having faith in me. Looks like I'll have to be even more thorough in my preparation from now on.
M1895MG|Introduce|Greetings, this is M1895 Colt-Browning Machine Gun, here to report for duty... This IS Griffin HQ, right? ...Great, I'm in the right place.
M1895MG|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I've decorated your desk with flowers in a vase, Commander, I hope you'll like them... Is that surprising? Actually, spending time with you has taught me that these things aren't entirely useless...they lift your spirits, don't they?
Kord|DIALOGUE1|I've sorted out all the important matters. Give me a shout if you need me.
Kord|DIALOGUE2|What? ...I wasn't smiling? Sorry, I spaced out for a bit.
Kord|DIALOGUE3|"Survival for the fittest" applies to both humans and T-Dolls, right? So both you and I have to do better, Commander.
Kord|SOULCONTRACT|How may I help you, Commander? Huh, you're not asking for my help? <>My, what you just said won't be taken lightly. Can we really be completely honest with each other? <>Then let's show each other our true colors.
Kord|Introduce|Privyet, Commander. Kord reporting for duty. Ugh...it's a bit warm in here...
Kord|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Say, Commander! Turn around and give me a hug! Whoa! You actually did it... Is it really okay for me to be this coquettish? I might get carried away though.
VP70|DIALOGUE1|You are the most outstanding human being I have ever met, Commander, but that also means you keep getting assigned urgent and troublesome missions full of uncertainties... It's very unsettling.
VP70|DIALOGUE2|A board game? Just listening to the rules makes me feel uneasy... But I'll try my best to get over it for you, Commander!
VP70|DIALOGUE3|My mission for today is...uh...just to chat like this? The assignment you give are always so unexpected, though that isn't always so bad...
VP70|SOULCONTRACT|What's this? This round object seems pretty sturdy. <>It's for me? Thank you, Commander! <>From now on, I will never fear the unknown again. Holding this gift is enough to make me feel the calmness and serenity you give me.
VP70|Introduce|According to my scans, your programming seems to be relatively stable and not prone to bugs, which makes you the best candidate for my Commander.
VP70|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What's my mission today, Commander? Nein, don't tell me! It's kind of romantic to head out with you like this every now and then, without a clue about what we're going to do.
Six12|DIALOGUE1|Da dadada...lala...♪...Commander?! S-sorry...I couldn't get the new song I heard yesterday out of my head and ended up spacing out. I'm really sorry!
Six12|DIALOGUE2|Did I scare you? I'm not feeling sick. I've only curled up by your feet to get closer to you.
Six12|DIALOGUE3|The sea is nice, and so are you.
Six12|SOULCONTRACT|Commander? ...I understand. <>Um, well...if it's you, uh, what am I saying...? Anyway... <>Of course, I do! Please let me stay by your side and be your dependable shield forever!
Six12|Introduce|Six12 reporting for duty! I defer to your command.
Six12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I want to see the real ocean. Once the contamination is completely purified, my wish will come true as long as I'm with you, right? Then before that, please listen to this song with me...
INSAS|DIALOGUE1|Why are you staring at my hands? Humph, you've got good taste. This is mehndi, a famous tradition from my homeland. It's applied on the body for joy and luck.
INSAS|DIALOGUE2|This is a curry rice I just made. Try it. It's an honor to have an esteemed T-Doll like me cook for you!
INSAS|DIALOGUE3|What? Our objective this time is located on a snowfield? My, you're evil. You're trying to do me in with this mission, aren't you?!
INSAS|SOULCONTRACT|Hmm, I suppose it looks good enough for me, just barely though. <>Thanks. It fits just right so I'm not taking it off. <>I do have a lot of other expensive jewelry, but this is the only piece made for me with such dedication.
INSAS|Introduce|Humph, it must've taken you several reincarnations to accumulate enough good karma to recruit an esteemed T-Doll like me.
INSAS|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I made you tomato fried eggs on rice today since you mentioned you like Chinese cuisine. Try it. How does it taste? Isn't it super delicious?
HKCAWS|DIALOGUE1|"Griffin is a nice place." I can say it a few more times if that's what you want, but frankly speaking, I don't see a bright future in this line of work.
HKCAWS|DIALOGUE2|Why am I spacing out? I've finished my share of work, duh.
HKCAWS|DIALOGUE3|I may grumble a lot, but I never slack off when it comes to my duty. I AM being paid, after all. That said...don't expect me to be passionate about this job.
HKCAWS|SOULCONTRACT|An additional request? That's a very strange request, but up to you. <>...After all, even I don't have the heart to reject such an outstanding human. Sigh, I'm getting so much bonus in advance... looks like there's no chance I can quit now. <>Then I'll stay right by your side from now on. Please take care of me.
HKCAWS|Introduce|CAWS, at your service. There's no need to welcome me too warmly... Pay up and I'll get the job done.
HKCAWS|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You're leaning really close... Nein, it just takes some getting used to. It doesn't actually make me feel uncomfortable. Still, if you ever decide to switch jobs, remember to bring me along... I'll definitely make myself useful.
DP12|DIALOGUE1|Are you interested in folklore? Every place has a different culture and different legends. Studying how the same legend has changed as it spread to different places is like tracing a human's veins to the heart... What do you think?
DP12|DIALOGUE2|KSVK ran off? Don't worry. She just heard about a new theory and couldn't wait to test it out. Seriously. She didn't even listen to the whole demon-summoning incantation.
DP12|DIALOGUE3|A person's work is the manifestation of their mind. Sometimes, it even shows parts of themselves that they never noticed. For example, Commander, every time you put together an action plan, there's always...just kidding.
DP12|SOULCONTRACT|Gotcha, Commander. Now where's my reward? <>...I didn't expect it to be this. I thought it'd take you longer to give it to me... Still, I'm not giving it back. <>Then let's stay together and witness how all stories end...
DP12|Introduce|DP-12, here to provide physical and mental protection. Hmm...want to hear the story behind my name, Commander?
DP12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I don't want to stop reading or writing here at Griffin. Even though we'll leave the world behind one day, legends are eternal... I mean, would you like to be the protagonist in my novel?
Liberator|DIALOGUE1|Eating so much fried chicken is gonna make me put on weight...? Nah, fried chicken doesn't count!
Liberator|DIALOGUE2|You'd better not play favorites with certain T-Dolls, Commander. Humph...who do you think I'm talking about?
Liberator|DIALOGUE3|I wonder if our enemies also have a compelling reason to fight... If only we could talk to them properly.
Liberator|SOULCONTRACT|What's the matter, Commander? Asking me out like this isn't fair to the other T-Dolls... Huh?! This is... <>Commander...I'm sure you know how much I hate unequal treatment... <>Wow, what a grim face. I'm just kidding! Now that you've destroyed the balance, I'll have no choice but to give you special treatment as well. Do look forward to the days to come...
Liberator|Introduce|Hello, here comes Liberator, champion of fairness and justice! Commander, please wield me against all inequality!
Liberator|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You're spacing out, Commander. That's not like you. Is something on your mind? Spill it out. You can tell me anything...but you'll also have to treat me to fried chicken afterwards!
APSMod|SOULCONTRACT|You're sure about choosing me?<>Then from now on, what's yours is mine, and what's mine is still mine!
C96Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Huhhhh? Whyyyyyy?<>Is it 'cause I'm smart? Cute? Unusual? Or is it because I have a long history? Or...or... Fine...<>I'll just keep guessing right here by your side.
HK416Mod|GAIN|How am I different than before? Not too different. After all, scoring more than full marks is still full marks.
MP5Mod|GAIN|I'm no longer a child, alright? That's why, Commander, you can fully rely on me.
NTW20Mod|SOULCONTRACT|I've always obtained my strength from you ever since the beginning, and I've always kept that thought close to my heart.<>Now, I've finally found a chance to repay you. Thank you, Commander.
UMP9Mod|GAIN|I'm back, Commander! As a family, we won't get torn apart so easily!
DesertEagle|GAIN|Producer...no, I should call you "Commander", shouldn't I? Hello, I'm Desert Eagle, and I'll be joining your crew. Let's get along from now on.
SSG3000|GAIN|SSG 3000 has arrived at the destination. Awaiting your orders, Commander.
ACR|GAIN|Bushmaster ACR reporting for duty. I'll jot down everything carefully.
M1895MG|GAIN|Greetings, this is M1895 Colt-Browning Machine Gun, here to report for duty... This IS Griffin HQ, right? ...Great, I'm in the right place.
Kord|GAIN|Privyet, Commander. Kord reporting for duty. Ugh...it's a bit warm in here...
VP70|GAIN|According to my scans, your programming seems to be relatively stable and not prone to bugs, which makes you the best candidate for my Commander.
Six12|GAIN|Six12 reporting for duty! I defer to your command.

Liberator|GAIN|Hello, here comes Liberator, champion of fairness and justice! Commander, please wield me against all inequality!
KSVKMod|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I no longer see any confusion in your eyes. <>The time is ripe, and you are the sole truth within my heart… <>Oh oathsworn one, let us carve an eternal existence into each others' fates...
M950AMod|SOULCONTRACT|Hmph, so it's me in the end, huh?<>Ever since when? ...But I guess it doesn't matter now...<>Very well, let's become closer...and be mine...
Excutioner|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
Scarecrow|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
HowaType89|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is-is this...rice?! G-gosh, it isn't even an anniversary or anything, so why are you giving me something so valuable...? I-I'm gonna enshrine it! Huh? I'm not crying just because I see rice! These days when I can share my meals with you are much more precious than rice itself...
HowaType89|Introduce|Ta-daa! 89 Shiki Assault Rifle, reporting for duty! Oh my, Commander, I didn't know 64 Shiki was here as well.
HowaType89|SOULCONTRACT|Look, Commander! This is my new... Whoa! <>Don't think you can beat me with this thing! I-I'll make even more novel trinkets... <>Gosh, what am I talking about...? Commander, please put it on for me! Right now, I've got nothing to say other than "I do"...
HowaType89|DIALOGUE3|Hehe, what do you think about my new invention? It's a roomba that can do the laundry and cook porridge at the same time! Uh, I'll just leave it here with you for now. Don't let 64 Shiki see it or she's gonna faint again.
HowaType89|DIALOGUE2|My, what are you looking at? Look up - up! Hehe, twintails really are the best, don't you think?
HowaType89|DIALOGUE1|Huh? We have to queue for an hour if we can't go through the VIP entrance? Fine. Give me your ID number, Commander. I think we'd better get VIP tickets for the theme park.
VEPR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, the weather is sunny and visibility is good - an ideal day to observe wildlife on the savannah. If you have time, would you like to...
VEPR|Introduce|Zdrastuyte, Commander. I'm Vepr. It's an honor to serve you— Wait, please don't scan that barcode!
VEPR|SOULCONTRACT|Can I really have this? They say it can't come off once it goes on... <>I understand, thank you for your trust and support. <>I now declare you to be a permanent member of the Wild Boar Protection Association.
VEPR|DIALOGUE3|Are you worried I'd be bored on my own, Commander? You don't have to. Instead of forcing a conversation with someone, I'd much rather be left alone.
VEPR|DIALOGUE2|Are you free, Commander? May I take two minutes of your time to do a little survey? It's about your favorite animals. I'm trying to find potential members for the association.
VEPR|DIALOGUE1|Sorry, Commander, I'm on a mission right now and can't really talk... Of course, if you want to learn more about wild boars, I'd be very happy to have a conversation.
SL8|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I've been very interested in swimming lately... Wanna go together? What, my body isn't very waterproof? Then I'll just play outside the water!
SL8|Introduce|Wow! Nice to meet you, Commander. You seem fun.
SL8|SOULCONTRACT|Got something cool to show me, Commander? <>An oath? Oh, sure! In return, please keep this certificate I ordered. <>An oath is meant to be exchanged, right?
SL8|DIALOGUE3|Need my help with that? Don't worry, what happened at the café was an accident! I didn't know Gr G36's headband would break so easily.
SL8|DIALOGUE2|It's okay to be nostalgic, but not everyone has to feel that way, right? Some people look into the past, then someone must look into the future. Which are you, Commander?
SL8|DIALOGUE1|The old toy? I got bored with it and chucked it. More importantly, Commander, what new stuff have you got? Show me and let's study it together?
RPK16|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You and I are like a moth dancing in the candle light, entangled by the flames. It's tragically beautiful how the moth will ultimately be reduced to ashes as the candle goes out in billowing smoke. But who's the moth and who's the fire? ...C'mon, you've got to make yourself special, Commander.
RPK16|Introduce|We meet again, Commander. I told you we'd run into each other again soon enough. Just as a moth is destined to chase after the light... That's an odd metaphor? You think so?
RPK16|SOULCONTRACT|What intrigues me the most about interpersonal relationships is this kind of fragile vows. <>Real trust doesn't need to be bound by names and titles, while a broken relationship can't be maintained with just a ring... <>So which one is it going to be for us, Commander?
RPK16|DIALOGUE3|Humans are like fluffy bunnies in the scorching sun. If they stray too far from each other, they die of loneliness; if they huddle too close together, they feel uncomfortably hot. Fascinating, don't you think?
RPK16|DIALOGUE2|Why do I keep staring at you? What, am I making you embarrassed~? Pfft, relax. Unlike 12 or 15, I'm not equipped with an advanced optic system. I'm just observing you with these plain and simple eyes... That's what makes you feel bashful? Really?
RPK16|DIALOGUE1|Only when humans started questioning God did they develop an independent sense of self... Now if Dolls started questioning our own creators, what would happen? Haha, just kidding. Did I scare you?
M82|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Salute! Good morning, Commander. It's another busy day...but that's okay. Just trust me as always and give me your orders. I will solve all your problems spectacularly.
M82|Introduce|Valmet M82, reporting for duty. I hope I can stay by your side...as long as you deem me useful.
M82|SOULCONTRACT|...I can't believe you're actually saying this to me. <>All this time, I've been worried that I'd be abandoned and forgotten. <>But now, there's someone who'll always need me? <>...Kiitos.
M82|DIALOGUE3|Miss MG36 seems to like sci-fi a lot. She's so passionate when talking about the subject, it's actually a little scary. Still...I'm glad I found someone whom I can share my hobby with.
M82|DIALOGUE2|I'm not worried what kind of difficult situations I'll run into. Since I chose to pick up a weapon, I have prepared for the worst... What worries me is something else - something even more frightening than death.
M82|DIALOGUE1|I just saw a really dashing lady in the corridor. I was going to chat her up, but she seemed so strict and severe... I hope I'll run into her again.
AK15|DIALOGUEWEDDING|It bothers me so much. Why does 12 like wasting resources on doing meaningless things? I simply can't get along with her... Nyet, sorry, I shouldn't be complaining to you about such trivial matters. Please forget it.
AK15|Introduce|Nice to meet you, Commander. I am AK-15, Tactical Doll on active duty. Please issue commands efficiently.
AK15|SOULCONTRACT|...I don't understand. This order serves no purpose. <>I'll obey your command even without this unnecessary bond. <>Still, have it your way... If this is what you want, I'll comply unconditionally. <>You have proved to be a trustworthy Commander.
AK15|DIALOGUE3|12? ...Sorry, but we share nothing in common other than our manufacturer. I don't quite understand the way she works either... For the sake of efficiency, I advise against making us work together.
AK15|DIALOGUE2|When I close my eyes, all I see is your typical darkness. I neither like nor dislike it... I simply enjoy the peace and quiet.
AK15|DIALOGUE1|...Were you talking to me? Sorry, I was in sleep mode and didn't catch that. Could you repeat that? It wasn't important? Please, I insist.
06TypeSMG|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Working so late again, Commander? I've prepared a little hotpot for you as a midnight snack! Relax, it's only miiiiiiildly spicy! Your face is so red you look as if you're gonna start belching fire... Fine, I'll get a double-sided pot and make two soup bases.
06TypeSMG|Introduce|Wow! I've finally found a place where I can have hotpot, how cool is that?! Ahem, I mean, hello, Commander...
06TypeSMG|SOULCONTRACT|(Sobs) I'm finally getting acknowledgment from you, Commander... <>In return, I'll have double-sided hotpots with you... <>I'll give you the last slice of beef and even the last mouthful of grass jelly...
06TypeSMG|DIALOGUE3|Heading out for a mission, Commander? Then I'll prepare some sunscreen, snacks, beer... What? You're not taking me?!
06TypeSMG|DIALOGUE2|Commander, are you done with your work today? Then let's go for a late-night supper! What about the spicy hotpot we had last—why are you suddenly running so fast?!
06TypeSMG|DIALOGUE1|I don't know who told me this, but the "V" sign means happiness. I hope I can spread this happiness to the people around me, so I do it a lot. Huh? That's not what it means?
Webley|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I've ordered a new set of clothes tailored for you. Yes...a suit that matches mine. Come to my room tonight for a fitting.
Webley|Introduce|I am Webley. I've been waiting to make your acquaintance. Please show me to my dormitory. I have a lot of belongings to set down.
Webley|SOULCONTRACT|You loosened your tie... Humph, even I can tell why you're here. <>Then...do you even have to ask...? I'll let you get away without a kiss since there's so many people around. <>...From now on, I'm going to have to devote all my time to you.
Webley|DIALOGUE3|I hope a larger wardrobe can be arranged for my quarters. My current wardrobe is too full to hang my new suit.
Webley|DIALOGUE2|You want to take me to the seaside? You want to see how I'd dress for the occasion? ...N-no! No chance at all! I don't mind showing you my outfit, but if I go to the seaside...you'll definitely lose me! You absolutely mustn't let me anywhere near the ocean!
Webley|DIALOGUE1|Don't worry. I will exhaust all possibilities to bring you victory... Why? That's because I know I shoulder the hopes and dreams of many. It is my duty as a Tactical Doll to bring glory to your name.
Danuvia43M|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I've always wanted to ask you a really presumptuous question... May I call you...ugh! Never mind!
Danuvia43M|Introduce|Jó napot, Commander! Nice day, isn't it?
Danuvia43M|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, this component is meant to be mounted on...? <>Huh? It fits my ring finger perfectly! I'm so happy... <>You really are a perfect match for me, Commander!
Danuvia43M|DIALOGUE3|Huh, Commander? It's very late already, aren't you going to sleep? I'm looking for a lost hairpin. It isn't particularly important, but it's hard to find hairpins of that exact size...
Danuvia43M|DIALOGUE2|You cut your hand? Don't move. There is antiseptic and...the candy that you like in my bag.
Danuvia43M|DIALOGUE1|You don't seem very happy, Commander? How about I tell you something interesting?
CR21|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Didn't I tell you not to eat junk food, Commander? Fine...just this once. You'll have to exercise more after work.
CR21|Introduce|CR-21 joining the roster! Leave everything to me, be it security or your daily fitness training!
CR21|SOULCONTRACT|Commander? Why have you gone out of your way to talk to me...? <>Huh?! Are you for real? So...you won't run away even if you have to train with me every day? <>Since you're so determined, I'll also do my best and not let you down!
CR21|DIALOGUE3|Fitness exercises have no effect on Dolls, but humans tend to be influenced by their peers, right? So if I keep this up, you'll join in, won't you?
CR21|DIALOGUE2|No junk food! If you must eat it...then burn the extra calories with me first. No problem with that, right?
CR21|DIALOGUE1|You're in pretty good shape, Commander, but there's still some excess fat here... Want me to set you a training plan?
KAC|DIALOGUEWEDDING|The letter Gr Mk23 put on your desk? I didn't see it... Maybe she was trying to trick you! C'mon, Honey, don't think too much of it. Just get back to work. I'm gonna clear the trash for you...
KAC|Introduce|K-PDW, salute! You smell of grapes... You really are the Honey that I've been waiting for! Don't be a stranger - just call me "Honey" as well~ ❤
KAC|SOULCONTRACT|Why are you suddenly giving me such an important gift? Even if you don't, I totally understand your feelings, Honey... <>Yeah! From now on, I'll keep staying by your side, Honey. ❤ <>That'll show the stupid Dolls who it is that Honey cherishes the most, heh...
KAC|DIALOGUE3|Honey, you seem to be quite curious about my hair buns? Then I'll tell you a little secret. Actually, my buns are fresh food storage containers. I can hide a bunch of grapes in there. ♪
KAC|DIALOGUE2|If I see you stupid Dolls stealing my grapes, I'll... Oh, Honey? What do you mean howling? As if I'd do something like that...
KAC|DIALOGUE1|Honey, open wide. Say "ahh" - I picked these fresh grapes myself. Do they taste good?
SIG556|DIALOGUEWEDDING|All it takes to remember a person is a hashtag. To me, your hashtag is... Oh, I'm still on duty! Back to work, I'll tell you afterwards!
SIG556|Introduce|Trendsetter SIG-556, heyo! Surprised by my outfit? The latest hashtag trend is "controlled frenzy", after all!
SIG556|SOULCONTRACT|I'm here, Commander! Got any new ideas that you wanna discuss with me? <>An oath? With me? Is this a new hashtag for me? <>Very well then, we'll make it a permanent one!
SIG556|DIALOGUE3|The patterns on my gun and trousers? Oh, they're stickers that I modified myself. I bet they're gonna become my trademarks by the time I leave Griffin!
SIG556|DIALOGUE2|To me, fighting is all about a lot of courage and a little bit of technique. It's up to you to put my strength to use.
SIG556|DIALOGUE1|Hey, Commander? What do you think of my outfit? Fits my latest hashtags pretty well, huh? I made it using scrap materials around the base.
C93|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I've always wanted to be famous...but to tell the truth, I'm simply afraid of being in the shadow of so many Dolls. Maybe I'm just trying to make someone notice me... I'm the best, you say?! Danke, my love.
C93|Introduce|Ta-daa! Borchardt C-93, reporting for duty! Oooh, I know you. You're a celebrity. Heh, there must be plenty of opportunities for me to be in the limelight here.
C93|SOULCONTRACT|It's really pretty here, Commander. What can I do for you? <>...! Is-is this really for me? I'm not even that famous yet. <>I can see that your eyes are serious... Hmm, I do. I also want get to know you better... Let's take care of each other from now on.
C93|DIALOGUE3|All these butterflies are fluttering around me because I smeared pollen onto myself. Why? Because I love them. I also like caterpillars, spiders, etc. Uh, Commander? Why are you making such an odd face?
C93|DIALOGUE2|Commander, the press is here! ...You don't want to show everyone your charismatic self? ...Are you worried about something? Then I won't go either. After all, I'm only a famous Doll when I'm with you.
C93|DIALOGUE1|Hehe~♪ Why am I so happy? Heh, I've finally figured out what I'm gonna say to the press. Wanna know? Then I'll tell you, just because it's you! "First I would like to thank my country, my Commander, and..." Hey, Commander! Where are you going?
MAT49|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You wish to know what I have been doing for the past few days? Well, while doing my research, I found out that knights in the past rode horses, so I spent the last few days trying to capture a horse...
MAT49|Introduce|Lord Commander, are you the charge that I am destined to protect?
MAT49|SOULCONTRACT|Are you really giving this solemn duty to me? <>I know I'm not good enough to deserve this as it takes everything I've got just to ensure your personal safety. <>But don't worry, I shall keep your heart safe even if it costs me my life.
MAT49|DIALOGUE3|The reason why I want to be a knight? It's nothing special, really... I simply want to protect the person that matters to me without being a nuisance...
MAT49|DIALOGUE2|Lord Commander, as always, allow me to escort you to your quarters. I know the base is relatively safe, but I can only rest easy after affirming that you've reached your room safe and sound with my own eyes.
MAT49|DIALOGUE1|Do you like my hair, Lord Commander? When playing with it, please be careful not to knock out my bad luck inhibitor...
ZasM76|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Come here, Commander. What? Ne, it has nothing to do with SVD! I just want to talk to you alone... Can you spare some time and listen?
ZasM76|Introduce|Zdravo, Commander. I am Zas M76. Please look forward to my performance. I will prove myself better than SVD in every aspect.
ZasM76|SOULCONTRACT|You've chosen me...you say...? <>I knew it. It's because I'm better! What? There's another reason? You just want to know my answer? Then... <>Da! ...I do, and I'll never ever let you down!
ZasM76|DIALOGUE3|A new mission? ...No? You just want to have a chat with me? Alright, then let me give you a detailed comparison between SVD and me.
ZasM76|DIALOGUE2|SVD turned me down again when I challenged her to a duel. I'm gonna show her next time! ...Hmm? Commander? W-when did you come in?!
ZasM76|DIALOGUE1|Commander, what do you think about me? Am I better than SVD? Give me a straight answer! Don't dodge the question!
DP12|TIP|These little things can make your job go much more smoothly.
DP12|SKILL2|You're not getting past me.
DP12|FIX|The way I look now, I'll probably scare the next person who comes in.
DP12|BREAK|Holy... They really do pack a punch.
DP12|RETREAT|Sorry, this is the best I can do... Will you forgive me?
DP12|HELLO|As always, you showed up at work on time.

DP12|MEET|Here, surprise.
DP12|OPERATIONBEGIN|Will we be operating at night? I want to show off what I can do.
HKCAWS|CHRISTMAS|This year, my Christmas wish is to jump ship and go work for a company that's less crazy. But before that, I don't mind playing with you for a bit. Oh, relax. I won't charge you this time.
M1895MG|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. Here's a New Year gift for you... A folder would be pretty useful, right?
4type|NEWYEAR|Oh, Commander? Making New Year visits? Sure. I’ve been rushing deadlines- I mean, I’ve been training so hard...I feel rather burned out. Going out in the first month of the year and immersing in the auspicious air might just give me some inspiration.
R93|COMBINE|Thank you, Commander. I can feel the good vibes coming!
PA15|NEWYEAR|The first day of each year is a brand new beginning, so let's start it with trying out some new tactics?
PA15|BUILDOVER|Oooh, a cutie I can play with?

MG36|NEWYEAR|We made it through another year, Commander. I need to say something auspicious to get the red packet? Then...live long and prosper.
Falcon|NEWYEAR|Ooof, Little Lamb! There you are! It’s full of people and exploding fireworks everywhere. Hide with me somewhere or I’ll feel guilty for not visiting the others…
Type100|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas, Commander. Huh? I should dress up too...? Will that really...make me look prettier...?
JS9mm|NEWYEAR|It's been a whole year, Commander. It's really time you fixed this nasty habit of yours. Don't burn the midnight oil today.
WA2000|VALENTINE|I just happen to have some extra chocolate! I won't forgive you if you turn it down!

PDW|CHRISTMAS|Christmas is such a joyous occasion. The mood is pretty good right now so here, take my gift!
NTW20Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, want to go for a ride with me today? I found a great place to floor it. Don't worry, you won't fall off as long as you hold on tight.
NTW20Mod|Introduce|Sniper rifle NTW-20 in position. Awaiting further directives.
NTW20Mod|DIALOGUE3|You don't seem to be in a good mood. Have some amarula. Don't worry, unlike THEIR "water of life", this is a sweet and mellow liqueur.
NTW20Mod|DIALOGUE2|Be it an eagle soaring in the sky or a beast sprinting across the land, once it becomes my target, it won't escape the fate of falling.
NTW20Mod|DIALOGUE1|Commander, don't sneak up on me from behind like that. It's dangerous...

C96Mod|Introduce|See, Commander, don't I look a lot more refreshing now?
C96Mod|DIALOGUE3|Gr HK45 has been asking me to rehearse a new dance number with her lately, but they're clearly battle drills.
C96Mod|DIALOGUE2|It feels nice to loosen up every now and then. It doesn't get too warm when huddling with the Commander even in this big coat.
C96Mod|DIALOGUE1|This new uniform is much more convenient than the old one. When it gets too hot, I can just whoosh—and take it off!
AR15Mod_Live2D|SKILL3|I shall bury you with all your pain!

APSMod|Introduce|Brand new military machine pistol Stechkin, or APS, at your service. Dear Commander, have you missed me?
APSMod|DIALOGUE3|Commander, I've been wondering... Do you think the world only seems peaceful because we're here...? Haha, you're right. Such nonsense.
APSMod|DIALOGUE2|Why did you carry the pile of documents yourself? Gee, just leave that to me next time. I'm on your payroll, after all. I don't want to owe you any more favors.

CAR|GAIN|C-Commander... Hello, I'm CAR... Y-you'd like to welcome me? No, no thanks. I'm just glad this place is safe...
HSM10|GAIN|High Standard Model 10 shotgun, reporting for duty! Commander, you have my allegiance!
APSMod|VALENTINE|Commander, please accept this chocolate as a token of my affection... Heheh♪ Of course, it's not free!
KSVKMod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Oathmaker, I receive thy wish. I shall give it my all to attain what you've been working for.
KSVKMod|Introduce|It's been a while, destined Commander. As always, I shall bear witness to your journey with these new eyes!
KSVKMod|DIALOGUE3|Weakness is no reason for hesitation; similarly, strength is no excuse for cruelty.
KSVKMod|DIALOGUE2|Love and the desire to protect are the tenderest and most resilient of all feelings. They have nothing to do with how strong a body is.
KSVKMod|DIALOGUE1|What is it? You keep staring at me. Just because I've shrunk doesn't change anything - except our feelings.
M950AMod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What's the plan now, Commander...? If possible, I'd like to in-invite you to take a stroll with me outside... Phew, I finally got that out.
M950AMod|Introduce|M950 returning to Griffin in a brand-new form! Commander, allow me to protect you from now on.
M950AMod|DIALOGUE3|I used to hate myself for being so by-the-book and locking myself in a cage of loneliness... But you still accepted me and never deserted me... So now, I've come to like myself. Please let me watch over you.
M950AMod|DIALOGUE2|Commander, have you noticed anything weird about Thunder lately...? She's always...staring at me when she thinks I'm not looking...
M950AMod|DIALOGUE1|You asked to see me just to have a chat? Sure, I've got lots of things I want to say to you.
CAR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I hope you'll remember my name...even if you're the only one who does.
CAR|Introduce|C-Commander... Hello, I'm CAR... Y-you'd like to welcome me? No, no thanks. I'm just glad this place is safe...
CAR|SOULCONTRACT|I can have your blessings...even though I'm just a nameless pawn? <>Thank you very much. In return, I'm happy to keep serving under you... <>Commander.
CAR|DIALOGUE3|Ah, better not touch this fire extinguisher! It's our final resort when danger arises.
CAR|DIALOGUE2|Take a good rest, Commander, and leave the rest to me.
CAR|DIALOGUE1|Commander, is the base completely secure...? If there's a fire...I probably won't be of much use, but I'll help!
HSM10|DIALOGUEWEDDING|From now on, make sure you tell me if you get hurt; I always have a medkit with me... To protect others properly, you must first take good care of yourself...so that you can charge into battle in the vanguard with me!
HSM10|Introduce|High Standard Model 10 shotgun, reporting for duty! Commander, you have my allegiance!
HSM10|SOULCONTRACT|What are you hiding behind your back, Commander? Is it anything dangerous? Give it here— <>Huh? H-how can it be a ring? Don't tell me...it's for someone else? <>Ha, just kidding. But if it is, I'm going to have to arrest you, you hear?
HSM10|DIALOGUE3|You have nightmares when you sleep? Can't be helped then, I'll be your special guard tonight. I'm here, so sleep tight.
HSM10|DIALOGUE2|You remind me of my previous boss a lot... Huh? In what way? I suppose it's the way you treat people? Also...you're very nice to me.
HSM10|DIALOGUE1|Don't be shy, everyone is like family to me, so just come and help me with the noodles tonight, okay?
M1014|VALENTINE|Be careful, Commander. This chocolate will go bad if it isn't stored at this specific temperature, so make sure you follow the instructions.
ZastavaM21|VALENTINE|Valentine's Day is just a random festival hyped up by businesses. It's clearly a commercial trap, so why is everyone still so happy about it?
ZastavaM21|COMBINE|If you look closely...I'm actually...quite cute.
RMB93|VALENTINE|I've booked a hotel and ordered flowers and food tonight... And this chocolate is also for you.
PM|VALENTINE|I'm teaching everyone how to make chocolate. Commander, could you be our taster?
M950A|WIN|You got this result mostly thanks to me. Remember that.
M950A|FIX|You're here to visit me? That makes me quite happy.
M950A|RETREAT|Even I miscalculate things once in a while... But it isn't...actually so bad, is it...?
M950A|BREAK|Tsk... I wanted to impress you for once... (Mutters)
M950A|HELLO|So, have you decided what to do today? ...I'm fine with anything.
M950A|VALENTINE|Here, this year's chocolate... Huh? You thought I'd forgotten? I remember better than you.
M950A|BLACKACTION|Let me help. I don't have much to do anyway.
M950A|PHRASE|Hurry up.
Grizzly|VALENTINE|What kind of clever idea does M1911 have today? ...No, I should come up with something on my own this time!
FNFNC|VALENTINE|Commander, I'll give you half of my chocolate! Let's eat together~
APS|VALENTINE|Commander, please accept this chocolate as a token of my affection... Heheh♪ Of course, it's not free!
98K|LOADING|Just a second, bitte.
98K|RETREAT|I'm so sorry, but this is the best I can do.
98K|BREAK|You really did something unforgivable.
98K|SKILL3|Dummkopf... Deutsch technology is the best in the world!
98K|FIX|Another repair? So who's going to serve me this time?
98K|HELLO|Guten Morgen, Commander~
98K|FEED|Well, isn't this great!
98K|VALENTINE|Commander, please give my chocolate a try.
Triela|GAIN|Hello, Commander. I'm Triela. Please leave your personal safety to me.
Triela|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I had a really sweet dream... I think I dreamed of my mother? She was wearing glasses and a lovely perfume... She held me tight in her arms...
Triela|Introduce|Hello, Commander. I'm Triela. Please leave your personal safety to me.
Triela|SOULCONTRACT|This is...? I see, say no more.<>I understood everything the moment our eyes met.<>It's hard to put these feelings into words, but surely you can sense them in my eyes...
Triela|DIALOGUE3|If you feel sad, come and have tea with me. There's magic in cake and a cuppa that can make people happy!
Triela|DIALOGUE2|I only know classical music and how to use guns. I haven't the faintest idea about the latest music or TV programs... I bet it's hard to find topics we're all interested in.
Triela|DIALOGUE1|I've been collecting teddy bears lately. I have eight so far. This is Augustus, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy...
Claes|GAIN|Claes reporting for duty. If possible, please let me maintain my own little gardening patch at the base.
Claes|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is there anywhere I'd like to go? If possible, please take me to the lake. I love being by the lake. Even when I'm not fishing, just spacing out there makes me feel calm and peaceful.
Claes|Introduce|Claes reporting for duty. If possible, please let me maintain my own little gardening patch at the base.
Claes|SOULCONTRACT|...Do you fully grasp the significance of doing this?<>Once I accept this keepsake, we can never be apart.<>This command cannot be overwritten – it's a blood pact.
Claes|DIALOGUE3|I've been reading botanical books about planting different vegetables lately. It'll come in useful when veggie aliens invade Earth.
Claes|DIALOGUE2|Feeling incredibly sad but the tears won't come. Have you ever experienced that?
Claes|DIALOGUE1|I once promised someone that I won't use violence when I have these glasses on.
Angelica|GAIN|Hello, I'm Angelica. If you need me for anything, please just give the order.
Angelica|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I'm writing my diary. I write down all the things we do together every single day so that I won't forget important stuff again...
Angelica|Introduce|Hello, I'm Angelica. If you need me for anything, please just give the order.
Angelica|SOULCONTRACT|Is this...a promise?<>I'll protect you, and you'll protect me, and we'll always be together...<>And we'll live happily ever after just like the Prince of Pasta and Princess Pizza...
Angelica|DIALOGUE3|I couldn't go the the training ground on the night of the meteor shower, but thanks to Triela, my wish of watching the shooting stars with everyone was granted in a way!
Angelica|DIALOGUE2|Can't sleep? Then let me tell you a story. It's called "The Prince of the Kingdom of Pasta"...
Angelica|DIALOGUE1|Amnesia is the most ruthless disease in the world. So many important things, be them happy or sad, end up being forgotten just like that. 
Rico|GAIN|Hello, Commander. I'm Rico. This is the first time I've been here, but I love everything about this place!
Rico|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, could you keep your distance while I'm carrying out a mission? When you're right next to me, I keep getting distracted as I worry about your safety...
Rico|Introduce|Hello, Commander. I'm Rico. This is the first time I've been here, but I love everything about this place!
Rico|SOULCONTRACT|I don't really understand the significance of this keepsake, but Claes told me it's a very important promise.<>Now that I have it, you'll never abandon me, right?<>In that case, as long as I keep it on when I sleep, I'll never have any bad dreams again...
Rico|DIALOGUE3|Every morning, when I wake up, the first thought I have is: "I wonder if I still have my body."
Rico|DIALOGUE2|I don't really understand what it means to be liked, it would be nice if someone liked me though!
Rico|DIALOGUE1|Commander, it's such a rare outing. Isn't it a shame if we go back just like that...?
Henrietta|GAIN|Hello, I'm Henrietta. Somehow you keep reminding me of someone else...
Henrietta|DIALOGUEWEDDING|If my feelings aren't reciprocated, if I can't get the answer that I want no matter what I do, I might just... Perhaps it's best to change the subject...
Henrietta|Introduce|Hello, I'm Henrietta. Somehow you keep reminding me of someone else...
Henrietta|SOULCONTRACT|I once thought there was this distance between us, that you were beyond my reach...<>Thank you for breaking down this barrier and letting me come close...<>Let's watch every starry sky together from now on, okay?
Henrietta|DIALOGUE3|You have a lot of work today, Commander. Don't worry, I won't disturb you! I just want to stay by your side quietly...
Henrietta|DIALOGUE2|Do you know the opera "Tosca" by Puccini? It's a tragedy, but I can relate to the intense passion depicted in the story... 
Henrietta|DIALOGUE1|The visibility is very high today, we could probably see the stars at night. If you're free tonight, please let me point out the Orion constellation for you!
Weaver|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
Alchemist|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
97typeSMod|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I've known how you've felt since a long time ago.<>But it's a little embarrassing to hear you say it out like this...<>In any case, why don't we go on a walk together first?
RO635Mod|SOULCONTRACT|I'm sure you have your reasons for choosing me...<>But, please don't stand so close, because everyone...everyone's watching... I'm so embarrassed!
SuperSASSMod|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, is there something special about today's get-together?<>Hm? Prepared for me? This is too much! Doesn't this mean I have to work even harder?<>Heheh, though this will be a piece of cake for me.
G11Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, what did you wake me up so late for?<>Eh? Could this be...that so-called "confession"? Seeing that wholehearted expression on your face, I wouldn't be able to sleep properly if I don't accept your feelings.<>Alright...just this once.
HK416Agent|Introduce|Agent of the Strategic Homeland Division, code name 416, reporting for duty under your command. Naturally, I will scrutinize your effectiveness as a commander.
HK416Agent|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Wake up. There are still a lot of tough battles ahead. If we are to win, we must face them together.
HK416Agent|PHRASE|Time is short.
HK416Agent|SOULCONTRACT|Things are far from over on this island, but I believe that with your help, everything will go much more smoothly. <>Of course, given the current state of this place, I hope you're prepared for loss and sacrifice. <>If you want life to return to normal, then pray for this whole ordeal to come to an end soon.
HK416Agent|BLACKACTION|I can handle this kind of battle with ease!
HK416Agent|COMBINE|I'm ready to give those enemies a nasty surprise.
HK416Agent|FIX|If we had more cover, things wouldn't have turned out so badly...
HK416Agent|OPERATIONOVER|I'm back. The stuff I found is over there. Go have a look yourself.
HK416Agent|OPERATIONBEGIN|I have no love for such a heavily contaminated place, but at least there's a chance of finding something good.
HK416Agent|SKILL4|I'm going to give you a complete burial this time!
HK416Agent|SKILL3|Disruption grenade thrown!
HK416Agent|SKILL2|The best is yet to be.
HK416Agent|SKILL1|Just you watch.
HK416Agent|CHRISTMAS|I hope peace will be our gift next Christmas.
HK416Agent|ALLHALLOWS|Prepare candy for children in the camp? There are many things left to do, but giving children hope is just as important. Let's get to it right away.
HK416Agent|TANABATA|Make a wish? As if I had time for such things... Alright, alright... I wish these blasted days of chaos will be over soon.
HK416Agent|VALENTINE|Chocolate contains a decent amount of calories, but they won't suffice as food supplies.
HK416Agent|NEWYEAR|A new year has begun, the situation is still as grim as ever, but more people will be joining us and we will slowly get the contamination under control. These are certainly cause for celebration.
HK416Agent|RETREAT|Things will only get worse if we stay...
HK416Agent|WIN|It's settled here. Get someone to handle the rest.
HK416Agent|BREAK|You'll regret this!
HK416Agent|DEFENSE|The enemies are still firing at full strength! Stand your ground!
HK416Agent|ATTACK|Let's tear through their defenses here!
HK416Agent|MEET|The enemies won't have mercy for the weak! Give it everything you've got!
HK416Agent|GOATTACK|Time to clean the vermin off the streets!
HK416Agent|BUILDOVER|They'd better be dependable.
HK416Agent|DIALOGUE3|We can discuss the operation plan with the Joint Task Force. They often have to venture into different streets and alleyways, they must have plenty of experience dealing with trouble.
HK416Agent|DIALOGUE2|Remember to disinfect any equipment brought back from the Dark Zone thoroughly.
HK416Agent|DIALOGUE1|Got nothing to do? Then distribute the food and medical supplies I procured to the residents.
HK416Agent|FEED|Intensive training? I'm game as long as it'll come in useful during combat.
HK416Agent|FORMATION|I need people who know what they ought to be doing.
HK416Agent|HELLO|We'd better get started with the field mission. It is incredibly unwise to cause any delays.
HK416Agent|GAIN|Agent of the Strategic Homeland Division, code name 416, reporting for duty under your command. Naturally, I will scrutinize your effectiveness as a commander.
VectorAgent|Introduce|Agent of the Strategic Homeland Division, code name Vector... Given the current situation, we must step forward. I, too, will make a stand when there is danger.
VectorAgent|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Run into a difficult problem? If we put our heads together, we might be able to solve it.
VectorAgent|PHRASE|For retaking the city.
VectorAgent|SOULCONTRACT|I believe the seed of hope will sprout between us. <>It will eventually grow into a force that can put an end to this endless winter. <>This is the choice I make. It is my hope...
VectorAgent|BLACKACTION|Initiating situation analysis with ISAC.
VectorAgent|COMBINE|The more strength we have, the sooner we can take back our city.
VectorAgent|FIX|I'm just glad I didn't catch it. Don't worry too much about me.
VectorAgent|OPERATIONOVER|I found lots of supplies that our people desperately need. Let's start distributing them at once.
VectorAgent|OPERATIONBEGIN|I hope we won't return empty-handed.
VectorAgent|SKILL4|Don't even think about breaking through my defenses!
VectorAgent|SKILL3|I'll give you cover!
VectorAgent|SKILL2|Max mobility!
VectorAgent|SKILL1|Come at me!
VectorAgent|CHRISTMAS|To me, time has practically remain frozen on this day. The long and lonely streets, the endless cold... I wonder when it will ever end.
VectorAgent|ALLHALLOWS|We need to create a moment of jump-scare? That won't be particularly challenging since we're definitely in the right place for that.
VectorAgent|TANABATA|My wish...? Take back the city... That's what I'm here for.
VectorAgent|VALENTINE|Nobody could've known that the chocolate they received last Valentine's Day would be their last taste of sweetness.
VectorAgent|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year. The change may not be too noticeable, but our efforts are already coming to fruition.
VectorAgent|RETREAT|It'd be nasty if I get infected here...
VectorAgent|WIN|The battles ahead will be even more arduous.
VectorAgent|BREAK|Ugh! If only we had a medical interface...!
VectorAgent|DEFENSE|Enemy fire is still very intense! Stay behind cover!
VectorAgent|ATTACK|The enemies are suppressed! Now's our chance to attack!
VectorAgent|MEET|Let's get this over with before things get any worse.
VectorAgent|GOATTACK|Commencing field mission.
VectorAgent|BUILDOVER|The more reliable allies we have, the better.
VectorAgent|DIALOGUE3|Agents used to have better logistics support. Why have things been reduced to such a sorry state...
VectorAgent|DIALOGUE2|I need to acquire more information about this place to have a better grasp on the situation's development.
VectorAgent|DIALOGUE1|Apart from food and water, we also need medical supplies, weapons, electricity... There are still a lot of things that we need to sort out.
VectorAgent|FEED|It'd be great if my immune system could also get a boost.
VectorAgent|FORMATION|Give me your best...
VectorAgent|HELLO|ISAC self-diagnostic completed. All equipment is functioning within normal parameters. All vital signs normal... Commander, I am ready for action.
VectorAgent|GAIN|Agent of the Strategic Homeland Division, code name Vector... Given the current situation, we must step forward. I, too, will make a stand when there is danger.
Tabuk|GAIN|Oh dear, why isn't the reception symmetrical? I'm sorry, but I'm going to pass out...
Tabuk|DIALOGUE1|Commander, I've placed the documents you need to go through in two piles. Please take one from each pile and work on them at the same time.
Tabuk|DIALOGUE2|What am I thinking? I'm thinking if only all decorative ornaments can be made in symmetrical pairs. The mirror is such a great invention.
Tabuk|DIALOGUE3|Commander, forgive me for this breach of decorum, but I must straighten your crooked shirt collar!
Tabuk|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, can we move to somewhere tidier first? <>Hold on, you mean...oh! As if I could pay attention to my surroundings when you drop this on me... <>I know I'm a fussy person, but if you're willing...I have no reason to refuse!
Tabuk|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I've put a mirror here. Not bad, huh? You can see our symmetrical selves whenever you look up...
Tabuk|Introduce|Oh dear, why isn't the reception symmetrical? I'm sorry, but I'm going to pass out...
TAC50|ALLHALLOWS|They say the voices of ghosts are a special kind of soundwave, so if we can synchronize with it, we might be able to speak with them.
ZB26|GAIN|So this is Griffin? ...I see. Please look forward to my performance. I will do my best no matter where I am.
ZB26|HELLO|Welcome back, I've already sorted the documents you have to look through.
ZB26|DIALOGUE1|Do you know, Commander? One should always take the initiative to interact with others... That's why I've come and sought you out.
ZB26|DIALOGUE2|I often think...Dolls are so close to humans, but why do the majority of humans refuse to understand us?
ZB26|DIALOGUE3|The objects aren't placed properly on your desk. That's alright, I'll tidy it for you... What? You won't be able to find your things? That...that won't happen.
ZB26|BUILDOVER|The rookies are here. Why don't you come with me and have a look? One can only grow by interacting with all sorts of people.
ZB26|BREAK|You'll pay...for pushing me so far!
ZB26|OPERATIONOVER|Well? Are you happy with the result?
ZB26|FIX|I'm sorry... I overestimated myself.
ZB26|SOULCONTRACT|Have you really considered this carefully? Once you've entered a contract with me... <>I won't let go of you no matter where you are… <>I will always, always be by your side.
ZB26|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Even though I often say one mustn't give up halfway, your working hours are way too long... I am putting you on mandatory break for a while. Don't worry, I'll keep you company.
ZB26|Introduce|So this is Griffin? ...I see. Please look forward to my performance. I will do my best no matter where I am.
MAS38|GAIN|Don't stand on ceremony, Commander! I do appreciate the big welcome, but I'm sure things will grow a lot warmer and cozier between us~!
MAS38|DIALOGUE1|Are my bags so distracting...? If exquisite and beautiful things can bring you happiness, why should you suppress your impulse of getting more of them?
MAS38|DIALOGUE2|Dressing in style can do wonders to a person's morale, Commander. Would you like to give it a try? If you let me handle it, you'll surely... Why are you backing off?
MAS38|DIALOGUE3|Some things may appear small and simple, but if you focus on them, you'll realize that it's a whole gigantic yet exquisite world...
MAS38|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, you've finally broken free of the constraints of your rationality and started embracing your own desires! <>Here, look at me. Look into my eyes. <>See? I can always picture our future together, and this is where it begins!
MAS38|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, you're having a headache because you don't know what to do with your time outside of work? Ahahahaha, let's travel! Of course you should spend your free time travelling! Just the two of us, right? How very exciting! Then let's start packing!
MAS38|Introduce|Don't stand on ceremony, Commander! I do appreciate the big welcome, but I'm sure things will grow a lot warmer and cozier between us~!
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE4|If you run into any danger, I can temporarily fill in as your bodyguard. Don't worry, I am capable of subduing most enemies as long as they are not elite T-Dolls...
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE3|Mr. Kryuger wished to know about your progress for the day. Did everything go smoothly? Hm, understood, Commander. I shall relay your answer to Mr. Kryuger.
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE2|Miss Kalina asked me to hand you the document that is currently on your desk. Please read through it, Commander.
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE1|Commander, these pastries are an introductory gift from my master K. Please give them a taste. Would you like me to refill your tea?
NPC_Maid|HELLO|Commander, the room has been cleaned and tidied, and your coffee is ready. You may now commence your work today in peace.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION15|My chest has been marred by countless scars, but fortunately, my heart is still steady as a rock. It is also the source of my resolve to protect you and Griffin.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION14|I can say for sure that you are the reason why Griffin survived the calamity. I have no doubts when it comes to your capability. I hope you can carry on and be a pillar to us all.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION13|With your performance, you have really proven yourself to be my aide-de-camp.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION12|I once thought I wasn't particularly good at expressing my feelings, but now it doesn't seem to be the case anymore. This could be thanks to you, Commander.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION11|People my age keep laughing at me for still dreaming of peace, but I really do, and this is exactly why we can fight together side by side.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION10|You remind me of my younger self. I didn't have much choice back then... But it's different for you. You still have a lot of opportunities – make sure you seize them and never let go.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION9|Instead of a subordinate, I'd much rather think of you as a comrade-in-arms who shares my vision.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION8|I have always done my best to protect what matters, and I kept losing them. But I still believe that things will all change one day.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION7|I didn't think you'd be that interested in my relationship with Havier... It's not exactly a secret, but it's a really long story.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION6|You want to hear about my experience in the Military? Understandable, but that will have to wait for a better opportunity.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION5|The improvement in your performance as a Commander has been even more rapid than the speed at which Helian submits her reports. It pleases me a great deal to see a subordinate so eager to learn.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION4|We owe each and every hard-earned victory to you and your Dolls' combined effort. I will never forget the glory you all have won for Griffin.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION3|Just hand any new report over to Helian. She'll sift through and summarize all the data.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION2|There's a change to this part of the plan? You might have some new insights if you approach it from a different angle.
NPC_Kryuger|CONTRIBUTION1|Relax, Commander. I'm just here to check on you.
NPC_Kryuger|AMUSEMENT|Since there doesn't seem to be any important matter at hand, I'm going to take a short break.
NPC_Kryuger|SUPPER|If there are things you absolutely have to finish today, at least make sure you have enough energy to do them. Kalina should still be around. Get her to fetch you some supper.
NPC_Kryuger|DINNRER|There's a banquet with the old geezers again, and I have to attend... I'm leaving everything here to you.
NPC_Kryuger|LUNCH|It's already lunch time. If there are any work-related matters that you can't drop at the moment, we can discuss it over lunch.
NPC_Kryuger|BREAKFAST|Have you had breakfast? Can you finish these off as well...? Yeah, they're all from Kalina, even though I've already told her not to go to the trouble.
NPC_Kryuger|MIDNIGHT|You seem to be in much better shape than me – it must be the difference in age. I hate to admit it, but it's just the truth.
NPC_Kryuger|EVENING|It's getting dark. Any incomplete tasks?
NPC_Kryuger|AFTERNOON|Things are starting to get busy. You've just got to love this hustle and bustle.
NPC_Kryuger|NOON|Are you tired? Don't force yourself just because I'm here. Humans can indeed stretch our limits, but you shouldn't expect results overnight.
NPC_Kryuger|MORNING|You seem quite energetic. Keep this up.
NPC_Kryuger|LOADING|This is the perfect opportunity to train your patience.
NPC_Kryuger|TIP|You have questions for me? If getting the answers will help, then by all means.
NPC_Kryuger|PHRASE|A shining beacon in a brave new world.
NPC_Kryuger|CHRISTMAS|In the past, snow at Christmas meant bad things would happen. Since I've had this assumption for a long time, I still believe it even to this very day.
NPC_Kryuger|ALLHALLOWS|Perhaps I'll have time to fool around with children once I retire, but until then, I'll leave this to you.
NPC_Kryuger|TANABATA|Make a wish? Hm, this probably sounds a bit idealistic... I wish for world peace. How's that? Not too bad, huh?
NPC_Kryuger|VALENTINE|Chocolate for me? That's nice of you... I might return the favor.
NPC_Kryuger|NEWYEAR|Peace still eludes this world. Please keep striving to be a shining beacon in a brave new world in the upcoming year.
NPC_Kryuger|BUILDOVER|Commander, new Dolls are joining your ranks. Be sure to cherish them and their contributions.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE10|Always remember - "A shining beacon in a brave new world."
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE9|It's good to take a break regularly; just don't let it interfere with anything important.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE8|It's the same with both humans and Dolls – once you have formed an emotional attachment, it will affect your judgment. I don't wish to discourage you. I'm sure you have already mentally prepared for that.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE7|The world is always the same world no matter which era we're in, but we must keep up with the times. That's the only way we can survive – for our sake, and for the sake of all mankind.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE6|Thank you. You did well.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE5|I'll just leave the statistics report on your desk, alright? Don't mention it, it's nothing at all.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE4|I never thought you also had an immature side...or are you showing it to me because you consider me to be more liberal?
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE3|Not only is an excellent Commander astute and decisive, they must also possess the resolve to make difficult choices and bear the consequences that come with them.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE2|Every setback will add to you experience. If you want to grow, failures are inevitable.
NPC_Kryuger|DIALOGUE1|You don't always need my approval. Just do as you see fit.
NPC_Kryuger|HELLO|Commander, I look forward to your performance.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION15|I am genuinely curious to see what will come of Griffin, which has been embroiled in all this chaos. Looks like these old bones will have to hang in there for quite a while longer.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION14|Will you be the one who restores "balance" to all things, Commander?
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION13|The balance has been broken, but the world is already striving for a new age of peace. Perhaps all new reforms are born of such tumultuous times.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION12|Persica and Lyco are both a handful, but I quite enjoy working with them.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION11|If the world was more peaceful, I might just be sitting in a fully automated sports car, cruising through a city right along the coastline.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION10|Instead of this tiresome state of affairs, why don't we discuss something more personal?
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION9|I'm finding our conversations more and more delightful. Try to give me some witty retorts. I might just satisfy your pointless curiosity.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION8|I've rambled a lot out of nostalgia, though I don't think my experience would serve as any useful reference to you in your current circumstances. After all, our values are rather different.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION7|Now that I think about it, I was also met with numerous obstacles during I.O.P's early days. Back then, I had to overcome challenge after challenge with nothing but my own wits.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION6|As Griffin continues to expand, the pressure you're under, the questions and skepticism you face will only increase. It is an inevitable part of the process.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION5|Just as how challenging it is for me to run I.O.P, it hasn't always been smooth sailing for Kryuger to lead Griffin. Are you ready to take over all the burden he has been shouldering all along?
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION4|Devising strategies on the battlefield is not the only thing you can do for Griffin.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION3|You really are quite similar to Kryuger. I can see why he holds you in such high regard.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION2|Not everything is black-and-white. Profit is often hidden in that murky area between black and white. It is unfortunate, but it is a fact.
NPC_Havel|CONTRIBUTION1|Entrepreneurs are all essentially profit-driven. This is my premise for choosing Griffin as my business partner.
NPC_Havel|AMUSEMENT|At my age, I can't afford to waste precious time on pointless recreation, but it doesn't hurt for a youngster to relax every now and then.
NPC_Havel|SUPPER|It's certainly nice to enjoy a little drink while all is quiet.
NPC_Havel|DINNRER|I don't think there are any dreary banquets tonight. Shall we dine together?
NPC_Havel|LUNCH|Lunch? My health management team should be delivering it soon.
NPC_Havel|BREAKFAST|For people my age, breakfast should be kept light.
NPC_Havel|MIDNIGHT|Still working even at this hour? Griffin certainly owes its efficiency to your diligence.
NPC_Havel|EVENING|Night has fallen, but there is no early rest for overseers like us, is there?
NPC_Havel|AFTERNOON|Don't forget you still have your scheduled meeting with I.O.P this afternoon.
NPC_Havel|NOON|Is it noon already? Shouldn't you at least take a break?
NPC_Havel|MORNING|You're up early. If only Persica shared your regular daily routine.
NPC_Havel|LOADING|Are you ready, young one?
NPC_Havel|TIP|Pay attention to the tips, child.
NPC_Havel|PHRASE|Now what?
NPC_Havel|CHRISTMAS|I never believed in Santa Claus, but then a lovely Doll gave me this Christmas hat and said I'd look great giving out presents if I put it on. Oh, the irony...
NPC_Havel|ALLHALLOWS|Oh bother. These old bones can't really take all this "trick or treat" business.
NPC_Havel|TANABATA|What a romantic festival. I suppose it doesn't hurt to relax on such an occasion.
NPC_Havel|VALENTINE|There is always so much business opportunity in the youngsters' festivals – like this little piece of chocolate. Perhaps I should try dabbling in the production and retail of processed foods.
NPC_Havel|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year. May our partnership continue to thrive in the upcoming year.
NPC_Havel|BUILDOVER|Your new Dolls are already complete? Then perhaps it's time to consider ordering a new batch?
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE10|Supporting you in your daring operations is always nerve-racking, but people who are overly cautious never amount to much.
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE9|Only when we all strike the perfect "balance" can I.O.P's profits be maximized.
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE8|Griffin's operations demonstrate the value of I.O.P. Judging by our recent Doll orders, our cooperation is mutually beneficial.
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE7|A good partnership needs to be properly maintained by both sides, don't you agree, Griffin Commander?
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE6|Before you act, make sure achieving your objective will yield tangible gains. That's a piece of advice for you.
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE5|How about a game of Raverbury chess, child?
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE4|If I think about it, I should have retired to the back lines a long time ago and just live out my old age in peace. What exactly is it that compels me to stay and obsess over this messy situation? 
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE3|It is very risky to try to obtain information unrelated to business from a businessman. Information does not come with a clear price tag, and making a bad deal is taboo.
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE2|It is never a bad thing to show some humility, young one.
NPC_Havel|DIALOGUE1|Do you wish to discuss new business?
NPC_Havel|HELLO|What is it? If I.O.P's service is urgently needed, I can make a rush order for you.
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION8|Since being an adjutant at Griffin is a long-term job, I should probably consider installing a fire control core or something...
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION7|"The Griffin Commander's trusted right-hand man". I like the sound of that~!
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION6|If you had only survived in Manhattan that day, I wouldn't have had such a tragic ending.
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION5|When I see you working so hard, I can't slack off either as the adjutant.
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION4|This has been a great chance to get a better understanding of Griffin – and certainly of you, Commander.
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION3|I remember you didn't use to look at me like that... Whatever. Laugh all you want.
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION2|I don't know if I'm a Doll or a human to you – you don't have to answer in a hurry. Even I don't know for sure.
NPC_Deele|CONTRIBUTION1|What happened in Manhattan has really given me some serious trust issues. In the past, I didn't trust people out of practicality, but now I just don't trust anyone out of instinct.
NPC_Deele|AMUSEMENT|Thinking about taking a break? Perfect! I've got plenty of games to recommend. I'm down with anything as long as we're not going back to Manhattan.
NPC_Deele|SUPPER|Supper looks really scrumptious tonight! Staying here isn't so bad after all~
NPC_Deele|DINNRER|Please don't treat me like a Doll at a time like this! I need food! The best there is!
NPC_Deele|LUNCH|It's time for lunch. Hey, you heard that? I don't want to stuff my belly with instant noodles!
NPC_Deele|BREAKFAST|Commander, where's my breakfast? What? I have to prepare it myself?!
NPC_Deele|MIDNIGHT|Is...isn't there any limit to your energy?
NPC_Deele|EVENING|You're still working? Whatever, I'm calling it a day.
NPC_Deele|AFTERNOON|Sorting out documents doesn't seem like much of a chore. Let me give it a go.
NPC_Deele|NOON|Have you decided what you're having for lunch? Not yet? Then I'll come and ask you again later.
NPC_Deele|MORNING|I look tired? Is that surprising?
NPC_Deele|BUILDOVER|Your new Doll is ready for action... I hope I'll make a good impression before the others start sharing gossip about my embarrassing past.
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE10|So those two agents also joined your ranks. Treat them well no matter what, Commander.
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE9|Ever since I came to Griffin as Dima, things have felt completely different. Why is that?
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE8|I ran into Miss Vivi today; she was as cold as ever... But I count myself lucky that she didn't draw her weapon at the sight of me.
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE7|It-it's Manhattan style! Since that's what I'm going for, I might as well pick something that looks good, right? Why do you care? You're jealous of me, aren't you?!
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE6|What kind of face do you expect me to make?!
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE5|Hey, what's the meaning of the sign that says "Dima only" next to the toilet? Explain yourself!
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE4|Even though I've given myself a Doll body, this is just a civilian model, so I will only carry out my duty as an adjutant. Don't even think about making me fight!
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE3|Ever since I was sent to Griffin as a Doll, I've been expecting you to drag the real me in as well. Commander, I know exactly what you're up to!
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE2|Well, this place is certainly more comfortable than that kind of freezing environment.
NPC_Deele|DIALOGUE1|I don't really care about the others, but even you are looking at me like that? Don't you understand my circumstances...?
NPC_Deele|HELLO|Commander, let's get started on today's work.
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION15|You're tired already? As a Griffin Commander, at least show some grit... Where do you feel sore? Here? Hmm... How's the strength? Is this good?
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION14|The Dolls look adorable in their wedding dresses. Which one...do you think would suit me?
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION13|I knew you'd come around now... Not that I was looking forward to it! It-it's just...this is the only time I can enjoy some peace and quiet!
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION12|I never noticed, but your schedule is really jam-packed... At least give yourself some free time, okay?
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION11|Do I still smell like booze? Whatever, at least only you have noticed...
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION10|W-would you be interested...in attending the next mixer? Don't misunderstand, there will be a few acquaintances, and it won't be too awkward if I bring you along. It's true!
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION9|The Dolls are gossiping about me again? That's fine, I'm used to it... But what about you? Have you never thought about this subject yourself?
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION8|Kalina is mainly in charge of logistics, though I haven't seen her all that much recently. Is she really so busy?
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION7|We do have quite a lot in common when it comes to the way we work.
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION6|Has there been a change to the deployment of our Doll echelons? That's okay, we can get that sorted with just a short briefing.
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION5|...I'm very busy right now. We'll discuss the next mixer later – uh, I need to go... Ahem! Commander, how can I help you?
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION4|I know you've won a lot of glorious battles, but the stakes will only get higher, so make sure you're mindful of your safety.
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION3|I came across a lot of couples on my way home last night – I thought it was some kind of festival. Young people these days...
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION2|I do dress casually in daily life, but work is work!
NPC_Helianthus|CONTRIBUTION1|Don't be so tense just because I'm here. Do I look like some kind of boss from hell?
NPC_Helianthus|AMUSEMENT|What's that TV show called again...? In any case, let me just write down that date idea into my proposal.
NPC_Helianthus|SUPPER|Commander, let's go get some drinks.
NPC_Helianthus|DINNRER|Yet another day has passed. I wonder why time has started flying by so quickly...
NPC_Helianthus|LUNCH|It's lunch break already. If you can't spare the time to get food, I can give you some of mine just so you won't be on an empty stomach.
NPC_Helianthus|BREAKFAST|Have you had breakfast yet? Make sure you eat something before you start working, or you'll find it hard to make it through the morning.
NPC_Helianthus|MIDNIGHT|I saw the light was still on, and you're really here... I finally understand why Kalina says her workload is nothing compared to yours even though she's already that busy.
NPC_Helianthus|EVENING|Is it already so late? Your zeal and diligence are commendable, but you should rest when its' time to rest.
NPC_Helianthus|AFTERNOON|It's barely afternoon and you're already nodding off? Sheesh, just how lazy are you when I'm not around?
NPC_Helianthus|NOON|Getting ready for your lunch break? That's good, regular rest is good for your health.
NPC_Helianthus|MORNING|It's only morning, don't look all tired. Perk up!
NPC_Helianthus|LOADING|Don't let down your guard.
NPC_Helianthus|TIP|Please refer to this manual if you have any questions.
NPC_Helianthus|PHRASE|There's nothing wrong with being single...
NPC_Helianthus|CHRISTMAS|Christmas present? Do you think I'm still young enough for that?
NPC_Helianthus|ALLHALLOWS|I've prepared some sweets here. Give them out to the kids when they're here... Why are you staring at me so expectantly?
NPC_Helianthus|TANABATA|If making wishes actually worked... If that really worked...!
NPC_Helianthus|VALENTINE|Chocolate? For me? Humph, this is just some childish game for young people... Wait, I didn't say I wouldn't accept it!
NPC_Helianthus|NEWYEAR|Commander, please pay special attention to the security of the defense areas during this period of time... Oh, by the way, Happy New Year.
NPC_Helianthus|BUILDOVER|New Dolls are reporting for duty... Commander, be sure to make full use of their potential.
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE10|I am about to make a report to Mr. Kryuger. If there is anything you would like to bring to his attention, you can tell me now.
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE9|You seem a little uptight. Are you usually like this?
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE8|You are not asking for my opinion, are you?
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE7|Dolls like that look cute? That's some good reference, but I don't think it's applicable to me at all...
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE6|It takes time to solve difficult problems; don't be impatient.
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE5|Mixers...? D-don't go asking stupid questions!
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE4|It is my job to assist you, but have some sense of propriety!
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE3|I hope you can submit a satisfactory report. That way, we can both perform well in our respective duties.
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE2|Commander, progress report?
NPC_Helianthus|DIALOGUE1|Is there anything you need? It's alright, just name it.
NPC_Helianthus|HELLO|Commander, as always, thank you for your hard work.
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION15|I never really noticed before, but your eyes are a beautiful color, Commander. How lovely.
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION14|What do you think about this oven? If you're happy with it, I'll buy one, and we can have cookies for supper from now on~!
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION13|I don't really like thinking about my past, but if things hadn't been the way they were, I would never have joined Griffin, and I wouldn't be standing next to you now.
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION12|I've issued all the assignments to the Dolls, and we've cleared our agenda for the moment. Heheheh, are your shoulders feeling sore? I can give you a massage~!
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION11|If only coordination among humans are as easy as it is among Dolls... Oh, nothing. Just a sudden thought, heheh.
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION10|Times like this are especially nice – we don't have to fight, and there's nothing to worry about at all. Heheh, wanna eat something, Commander?
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION9|Huh, my gaze is making you uncomfortable? I never knew you had such an adorable side. How surprising~
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION8|Commander, don't you have a tactical meeting with the Dolls? It's almost time, so just leave the data analysis to me~
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION7|Commander, you must be tired having worked for so long. You can take a little nap, I'll come wake you on time~
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION6|What do you usually do to relax, Commander? C'mon, tell me! I could use some suggestions.
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION5|Oh, the late-night radio program is getting more and more letters. Do Dolls have even more problems than humans?
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION4|Whenever a new Doll is registered, we have to confirm the caliber of the rounds they use. Now that I think about it, we must be dealing with dozens of different calibers? That's why working in logistics isn't easy at all.
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION3|Oh, we'll be meeting a client next. I've already made all the arrangements. Don't be late.
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION2|Commander, let's discuss the matter of improving the Dolls' MREs later, okay?
NPC_Kalina|CONTRIBUTION1|Commander~ I'm about to visit the Logistics Department. Got any orders?
NPC_Kalina|AMUSEMENT|Ah, Commander~ I'm just about to go feed the cats. Wanna come along?
NPC_Kalina|SUPPER|I always feel as if I hadn't eaten anything since lunch at this hour. Shall I prepare some supper, Commander?
NPC_Kalina|DINNRER|A good dinner is the best way to treat your body after a hard day at work, don't you think?
NPC_Kalina|LUNCH|Commander, it's time for lunch~ I've prepared a bountiful lunchbox~ Heheh, wanna try?
NPC_Kalina|BREAKFAST|I know I'm being long-winded, Commander, but breakfast is really important. Don't make your body suffer!
NPC_Kalina|MIDNIGHT|Ugh... Commander, don't your eyes ever get dry?
NPC_Kalina|EVENING|It's already pretty late, Commander. You aren't planning to spend the night in the command room again, are you?
NPC_Kalina|AFTERNOON|Commander, it's already afternoon? Yaaaaaawn~ I wish my nap could've been longer...
NPC_Kalina|NOON|Take a short break, Commander. At least preserve some energy for your work in the afternoon, or your body won't be able to take it!
NPC_Kalina|MORNING|Morning, Commander! Your agenda for today is on your desk. Feel free to ask me for help anytime!
NPC_Kalina|PHRASE|Commander, what are you buying today?
NPC_Kalina|CHRISTMAS|Seriously, if Santa Clause were real, he should've given me my money by now!
NPC_Kalina|ALLHALLOWS|Uh, do I really have to go? You just want to see me dressed as a monster, don't you?
NPC_Kalina|TANABATA|"Quick-witted and nimble-fingered"? I'm always so engrossed in allocating our supplies, I've never really thought about it...
NPC_Kalina|VALENTINE|Here, chocolate~! Uh, you want me to be more ceremonious about it? That depends on how much you invest in my White Day chocolate, heheh!
NPC_Kalina|NEWYEAR|Commander, Happy New Year~! Now that we've greeted each other, let's go for a hot drink together!
NPC_Kalina|BUILDOVER|The new Dolls have completed their registration~ Do your best, everyone!
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE10|Huh? I thought it's already time to host the late-night radio program, but it's actually still early.
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE9|Commander, why don't you try this office exercise routine? It's great for helping you relax~!
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE8|The claw machine I often go to has stocked some new plush toys. If I manage to grab any, I'll show you tomorrow~!
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE7|Oh, Commander! I'm just about to order some snacks. Would you like some too?
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE6|Commander, what are your orders? If you increase the budget for the Logistics Department, I'll gladly help~!
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE5|Is it already this hour? Let me get you some tea. The usual, right?
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE4|Commander, you're right on time! Here's the procurement list! If everything is in order, please allocate the necessary funds~ Heheh!
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE3|Com~man~der! Please focus on your task at hand!
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE2|Ugh, my shoulders are a bit sore... B-but it's fine~!
NPC_Kalina|DIALOGUE1|If all the surface recyclable materials extractors have already been dispatched, then the upcoming transport plans will have to be readjusted... Oh, sorry, Commander. I was lost in thoughts... Any orders?
NPC_Kalina|HELLO|Welcome back, Commander! I've listed out everything that needs to be done today! Please have a look!
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION15|You think my prosthetic can feel warmth...? Stupid bastard...
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION14|Have some tea. Now that we have some time, I don't mind if we get to know each other better.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION13|I don't like dreaming. It's annoying how all kinds of memories get dredged up out of nowhere.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION12|Recently, I've been starting to see some similarities between us, but then the idea always cracks me up.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION11|Hm, you're starting to grow on me... What did I think of you before? You don't want to know.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION10|In all seriousness, I have always thought of you as a friend when it comes to our aspirations.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION9|The end does justify the means.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION8|My usual life? Even if I had one, it wouldn't be particularly memorable.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION7|I seem to have scared quite a few of your employees here. It's mostly related to some trivial matters in the past, but I think I should try to keep a low profile while I'm here.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION6|Don't worry, I won't get in your way, but make sure you don't wander out of my sight either. I don't want to end up not getting paid for this job.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION5|I'm very much against violence outside of work. What, you don't believe me?
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION4|What about your Dolls? Isn't it more efficient to delegate more of your important tasks?
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION3|I do talk to people sometimes, just in rather unusual ways...such as bending them over and shoving them into the toilet. It's very useful in getting them to tell the truth.
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION2|We're in this line of work. What do you expect, daily counseling service?
NPC_Ange|CONTRIBUTION1|We should be a bit clearer on our division of labor – I'll come up with solutions, you think about the costs.
NPC_Ange|AMUSEMENT|Relaxation? Huh, so you're the type to put this down on your schedule.
NPC_Ange|SUPPER|Boosting morale with food late at night... Not a bad idea.
NPC_Ange|DINNRER|If you're interested, I can recommend a few MREs that I like.
NPC_Ange|LUNCH|I gotta say, this is much more sumptuous than your usual workplace meal.
NPC_Ange|BREAKFAST|It's breakfast! You expecting some kind of fine dining experience? Now shut up and eat!
NPC_Ange|MIDNIGHT|If you don't plan on turning in, then don't worry about whether I'm sleep-deprived. You're just asking for a thrashing.
NPC_Ange|EVENING|Not a bad day, eh?
NPC_Ange|AFTERNOON|Hey, are you already nodding off?
NPC_Ange|NOON|Griffin is quite generous with our lunch breaks. Guess I'll find something to do to pass the time.
NPC_Ange|MORNING|I've confirmed your schedule for today. It's going to be jam-packed. Want me to wake you up with some kind of drastic method?
NPC_Ange|LOADING|I'm busy. Leave me alone.
NPC_Ange|TIP|Now about the safety measures... Never mind, you'll watch yourself.
NPC_Ange|PHRASE|Not interested.
NPC_Ange|CHRISTMAS|A day when everyone has their guard down – even the Dolls. I might just go ahead and do something more interesting.
NPC_Ange|ALLHALLOWS|You're planning to give out candy to children at orphanages on Halloween? This isn't exactly my forte, but if you need any help, I can help you with some heavy lifting.
NPC_Ange|TANABATA|If wishes actually came true, my job would be a lot easier.
NPC_Ange|VALENTINE|Thanks for the gift, but I haven't got the time to prepare you something in return. How about a piece of information that's of equal value? For example, I've been trying to arrange Helian's mixers these last few days and it's been driving me... What? You're not interested?
NPC_Ange|NEWYEAR|New Year, huh... I rarely ever talk about my home country. We all have our memories... Well, I can tell you, but you'd better offer a sum that can compel me to talk.
NPC_Ange|BUILDOVER|There's no such thing as too many Dolls for you, is there? How about sending a few my way?
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE10|If you've got that much free time, you could go catch a wink at the medical room. Don't worry, I'm more than happy to cover for you.
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE9|So these are the confidential documents... Relax. If I'd really wanted to read them, I could've done it in dozens of ways.
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE8|You've got a good atmosphere going on – between you and your Dolls, I mean.
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE7|I hear your company had no qualms about letting you suffer extremely grievous injuries... Relax, I've been informed by an insider. It's worth knowing, don't you think?
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE6|...You feel uncomfortable under my watchful eye? This is my job. You get your safety, I get my money. Get used to it.
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE5|What, do I look like someone who lectures people on life philosophy?
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE4|In my book, curiosity is very likely to kill the cat.
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE3|If you can be more focused on your work, I may have an even better opinion of you.
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE2|You must be very confident in your ability to survive to be this foolhardy.
NPC_Ange|DIALOGUE1|Cut the crap and get to work.
NPC_Ange|HELLO|You're here? Then let's get cracking with whatever work there is.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION15|You want to know what good qualities I find in you? Due to the nature of my work, I have come to notice all the qualities that you possess – both the good and the bad. I like them all the same.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION14|I tried making some dessert today. If you don't mind, please give it a try... What, you've never been fed before?
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION13|Music? Do show me what genre you like.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION12|You want to hang around me? If it makes you feel safe, be my guest.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION11|My parents once supported me in learning to play the trumpet, but I ended up in an entirely different line of work.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION10|Never hesitate when it comes to important matters. I believe you will handle them just fine.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION9|I'm not tired. It doesn't get much easier than this kind of close protection work.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION8|In my line of work, I don't have the luxury of sipping coffee, so I do not have that habit.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION7|Your logistics officer is displaying some abnormal behavior. Should I increase surveillance on her? She's feeding the cats? Alright... But next time, she should inform me beforehand.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION6|I believe we now have a better understanding of each other. Hopefully, this will benefit our future cooperation. Sometimes, a lack of trust poses a serious problem when it comes to close protection work.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION5|You'd better give me a copy of your weekend agenda. It's for the sake of your own personal safety.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION4|I won't be here 24/7, but your Dolls should maintain the security arrangements I have put in place.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION3|I have run a thorough background check on the client you are about to meet. You have five minutes to discuss the upcoming project. As always, don't get too close and avoid all physical contact.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION2|Don't worry, I will not bug your room. It is not within the scope of my mission.
NPC_Jason|CONTRIBUTION1|Any action that is unrelated to the mission is pointless. I advise against this.
NPC_Jason|PHRASE|No comment.
NPC_Jason|CHRISTMAS|Compared to exchanging presents with you lot here, I'd much rather go back to my home country and enjoy a nice holiday.
NPC_Jason|ALLHALLOWS|Whenever I see children roaming the streets and asking for candy from their neighbors, I feel like all the sacrifices I have made are worth it.
NPC_Jason|TANABATA|I don't know too much about this festival, but if there's anything you need, I'll do my best.
NPC_Jason|VALENTINE|This is for me? It really isn't necessary, but thank you nonetheless.
NPC_Jason|NEWYEAR|I haven't thought of New Year as a festival since a long time ago... But if it's part of the job, I suppose it doesn't hurt to celebrate just a bit.
NPC_Jason|BUILDOVER|New Dolls? That's great, as long as they add to our strength.
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE10|Unlike us, whose lives are constantly on the line, you tend to consider the bigger picture. I guess this is why I have been sent to ensure your personal safety. 
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE9|I find it easier to work here than to deal with a certain someone.
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE8|You behave very differently when you're not in battle. I suppose this is an effective way of throwing off your adversaries. 
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE7|Many Dolls make unscheduled visits to your office. If it isn't for anything important, you should order them to stay at their posts instead of letting them run around.
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE6|Matters about Statesec? That's beyond my scope of employment.
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE5|There are quite a few destabilizing factors in the areas under your company's jurisdiction these days. You might want to avoid traveling there in person.
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE4|Take this kind of questions to Marlohe. She's much more proficient in solving these issues. Me? I'm just here to do my job. Any more questions?
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE3|This place reminds me of a certain operation in Germany. Things went pretty pear-shaped afterwards.
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE2|Unless you need to look outside, stay away from the windows. This is especially important when you're outside. It'd be best if you can make this a habit.
NPC_Jason|DIALOGUE1|I am here to ensure your safety, not work as your secretary. If you want that kind of service, ask your Dolls to do it.
NPC_Jason|HELLO|Leave security to me today and focus on your own tasks. I won't bother you.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION15|Weird... Where is my hair tie? Commander, could you please help me look for it...? I can't see at all without my glasses.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION14|Commander, I once told you I came to Griffin for two reasons. Having spent some time with you, I believe I have found a third.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION13|Good evening. Isn't it strange? I said I would never work over-time, but I'm just so worried about you. I'll be here gaming with the sound muted until you're done with your work.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION12|This prop... Are you also a fan of tokusatsu tv shows?! I've been obsessed with the genre since I was little! Many of those shows have aged incredibly well!
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION11|I usually keep up my image as a lady when I'm with strangers, but since you're hardly a stranger, Commander... Outta my way! I gotta kick Dier in the ass today!
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION10|You saw my acceptance letter? That's right, I did not enroll. One can only learn so much even at the best institute.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION9|If people are born for each other, and everything is predetermined... Then what's the difference between humans and Dolls?
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION8|There's a reason why Dier and I have different hair colors... No, never mind. It's nothing worth talking about. I might tell you when the time is right.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION7|A lady should be well-mannered and soft-spoken, but she shouldn't be defined by these qualities alone. That is why to this day, I have never stopped learning. I hope that one day, I will truly...
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION6|Unlike Dier, who specializes in mechanics, I'm interested in a wide variety of things – financial analysis, table-top games, fashion design, etc., etc. That's right, I designed 416's evening dress.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION5|Hm... Commander, do you think 416 looks better in a long evening dress or a short skort? She looks good in both, don't you think?
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION4|You never slow down in your work. You really should organize your time better. Would you like something to drink? Tea, coffee, or perhaps some milk?
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION3|I love my family, which is why I must take responsibility as an elder sister and keep Dier safe. This is the second – and the most important - reason why I'm here.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION2|Dier and I have received very good education, and we have enough financial support to pursue our studies and research in our preferred fields. We have our parents to thank for that.
NPC_Seele|CONTRIBUTION1|I trust our boss, Miss Angelia, and I believe in those she has chosen. This is one of the two reasons why I'm here.
NPC_Seele|AMUSEMENT|Relaxation is a must. How about a laid-back game of Gwent?
NPC_Seele|SUPPER|I know it's time for supper, but I don't eat after 9pm. You go ahead.
NPC_Seele|DINNRER|Let's get some dinner once we're done with work. Do you like drinking tea over dinner?
NPC_Seele|LUNCH|Lunch is essential. Don't delay it or you'll mess up your biological clock.
NPC_Seele|BREAKFAST|A refreshing cup of coffee should be a staple in an adult's breakfast. I've made one for you.
NPC_Seele|MIDNIGHT|(Yawns) You're still up? I've already slept my first round.
NPC_Seele|EVENING|It's time to head off, you know? I'll be going now. Make sure you watch the time.
NPC_Seele|AFTERNOON|Good afternoon, the remaining work is all yours. Shall I bring you some tea?
NPC_Seele|NOON|You should take a break during lunch time. You're working too hard.
NPC_Seele|MORNING|Good morning, Commander. I've arranged our agenda today.
NPC_Seele|LOADING|Are you in a rush? I'll open the door for you.
NPC_Seele|TIP|It doesn't hurt to memorize this.
NPC_Seele|PHRASE|I'm here.
NPC_Seele|CHRISTMAS|You're also putting out presents? How nostalgic... My family celebrates this festival. I'll have to send them their gifts via express delivery.
NPC_Seele|ALLHALLOWS|Sorry, Commander, but I don't want to leave the house today. I'm not afraid of the dark, but jump scares will interrupt my thoughts. Have fun though.
NPC_Seele|TANABATA|Make a wish...? I do have a lot of wishes. If I write down all of them, I'll need more than one card. I guess I'll just pick the one that's the least likely to come true.
NPC_Seele|VALENTINE|I have never made any chocolate by myself. I ordered this friendship chocolate just for you. The storage life isn't too long, so please finish it soon or share it with someone else.
NPC_Seele|NEWYEAR|Today is a great opportunity to rest up, so just relax. Here are the gifts that my family have sent the three of us... That's right, three. They got this for you to thank you for taking care of us. Happy New Year, Commander.
NPC_Seele|BUILDOVER|She will be a great addition to our ranks.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE10|416 is such a perfect lady on the battlefield, don't you agree?
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE9|Do you need some counseling? I might just be presumptuous, but you seem very lonely when you're staring at me and trying to make conversation.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE8|It's my principle to complete all my tasks during working hours. My time off is sacred and inviolable.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE7|All supplies at the base have been inventoried and organized. The accounts have also been audited. Here's a list of potential clients and partners. Please have a look.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE6|Even though we are currently under the employment of Griffin, you don't have to worry about our expenses at all. In fact, we still have close ties with our family.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE5|First impression matters, so I suggest you put more effort into your appearance.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE4|I'm alright with Dolls, though I'm better at communicating with humans.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE3|My skill set is quite similar to Kalina's, but I'm more adept at work that involves planning and organization, as opposed to external communications. Though if you need me to conduct negotiations, I'm also up to the task.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE2|If Dier makes any unreasonable demands, please make sure you let me know. Don't spoil him too much.
NPC_Seele|DIALOGUE1|Sorry, hang on. Right, saved... How may I help you, Commander?
NPC_Seele|HELLO|You came to work on the dot, Commander.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION15|I sometimes worry about you, but then I think you might not make the same mistakes that we did. You will break us out of this impasse, won't you, Commander?
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION14|Now that we are absolutely on the same side, there are certain things that I need to clear up with you. Or do you want to figure them out on your own? Then go for it, I'll keep my eyes on you.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION13|Sometimes I read fairy tales. If our forebears' theories could become reality, then the nice stories in the fairy tales could come true too, don't you think? Science is all about making the impossible possible.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION12|When I first came up with the Etching Theory, I was hoping it would create bonds, not cause destruction. I know it sounds hypocritical coming from me, but I sometimes look back at its development with regret.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION11|Commander, do you love your Dolls, or do you merely need them? Do you think there needs to be a differentiation between need and love?
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION10|I didn't really like coffee in the beginning, but I needed it. Then as time went by, I stopped being able to differentiate between need and love.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION9|Thinking requires energy, so coffee is quite conducive to thinking. How about five sugars? That's not too sweet, right?
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION8|I think you have all the outstanding qualities of a person that can be entrusted with important things. This is why I have entrusted the AR Team to you.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION7|You have stepped into a tenacious vortex, Commander. You shouldn't have been dragged so deep into this... You might never escape, you know?
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION6|Ange and I have known each other for...not really a long time, but not a short time either. You seem quite curious about that. Both she and I trust you a great deal – that's all you need to know.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION5|Meooooow. Huh, the Dolls with cat ears don't react to cat noises at all.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION4|I'm sleepy, so I'm taking a short nap. If anyone comes, remember to wake me.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION3|This storm caused by the flutter of a butterfly's wings – how many more years will it last...? Nothing, just talking to myself.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION2|Every researcher dreams of exploring the boundaries of their field. Lyco and I only make up two of the countless explorers out there.
NPC_Persica|CONTRIBUTION1|A lot of Dolls have gone through me – I still remember most of their names and functions, but a few of them no longer exist.
NPC_Persica|AMUSEMENT|Time to relax. Right, you relax, and I'll take a snooze. Lend me a shoulder... (Snores)
NPC_Persica|SUPPER|Time for a midnight supper, Commander. What do you like to eat? I've got plenty of snacks here.
NPC_Persica|DINNRER|Oh, the dinner menu here is quite different from what they have at I.O.P. What should I get...? Never mind, I'll just pick something randomly.
NPC_Persica|LUNCH|Don't worry about my lunch. Let me get some more sleep, I'm still sleepy.
NPC_Persica|BREAKFAST|Remember... (snores) breakfast...
NPC_Persica|MIDNIGHT|You're still awake? Huh, I thought I'd be the only one still working at this hour.
NPC_Persica|EVENING|Good evening, Commander. What's up? I'm wide awake now, so name your demands.
NPC_Persica|AFTERNOON|Ah, I'm awake. This is the perfect time to start working.
NPC_Persica|NOON|It's so bright outside. Don't you ever draw the curtains, Commander?
NPC_Persica|MORNING|(Snores...)
NPC_Persica|LOADING|The door...opens automatically.
NPC_Persica|TIP|I think I wrote this.
NPC_Persica|PHRASE|(Snores)
NPC_Persica|CHRISTMAS|I think people used to send electronic cards to each other to convey their best wishes. How do you guys celebrate at Griffin? You give actual presents? Alright, I'll go with you.
NPC_Persica|ALLHALLOWS|People have all kinds of weird customs for weird festivals. I've decided to give out candy to the ghosts in my dreams. Alright, I'm going to bed then. See you tomorrow.
NPC_Persica|TANABATA|If hanging my wish onto the tree will make it come true, I wish there are 48 hours in a day.
NPC_Persica|VALENTINE|Chocolate for me? Thanks, this kind of chocolate tastes great in coffee.
NPC_Persica|NEWYEAR|Even though we're both past the age of celebrating New Years, it's still nice to have some fun with the Dolls.
NPC_Persica|BUILDOVER|Oh, so this is the model we're getting.
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE10|The floor in the command room looks sparkling clean. I can walk barefoot in here, right?
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE9|The Dolls under Ange's command are all top of the line, but even they aren't almighty.
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE8|You don't actually think these cat ears are real, do you? They're just attached to my custom-made earphones.
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE7|You seem even more tired than me. Are you really okay?
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE6|Would you like some coffee as well? 10 sugars? Not that many...?
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE5|Sometimes, knowing too much might not be the best. Ignorance is bliss... Though you don't seem to agree at all.
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE4|I know Havier seems very sketchy, but he has always been good to me.  Personally, I don't really have anything bad to say about such a boss.
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE3|I know you have a lot of questions, but too many pairs of eyes are on both of us. I don't think it's a good idea to ask any sensitive questions.
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE2|I am here mostly to help you, but also to be with M4. She is a good girl – and my most precious masterpiece.
NPC_Persica|DIALOGUE1|I wasn't dozing off – I was just doing some thinking.
NPC_Persica|HELLO|Oh, you're here. Right on time.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION15|These pictures show what Lake Baikal used to look like? Such a pity that this vast and flawless scenery is now lost forever. Commander, if one day, the world manages to repair the damage mankind has inflicted upon this site, I hope I can travel there together with you.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION14|I once accompanied Master on a vacation by the Königssee. As I gaze upon the clean and serene water in those overlapping mountains, I felt indescribably moved.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION13|A gift for me? Look at this perfect color and sheen. Such lovely teacups... Thank you, Commander. I will treasure them.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION12|Whenever I see neat and elegant tea sets, I just can't help but appreciate them. That's my hobby, you say? Possibly...
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION11|Things I like...? Hm, discount cards and coupons are great; the newest vacuum cleaner and a dishwasher would also be nice.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION10|My master has made some modifications to my body. In an emergency, I can eject knives to attack the enemies. You think it's bad taste on Master K's part? Hm... I actually quite like this feature myself.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION9|How do I differentiate between good and bad? Hm... Anything the Commander allows me to do is good; anything the Commander forbids me from doing is bad. Is that not acceptable...?
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION8|Everything I do is for the sake of fulfilling your orders. Your wish is my command, and I will have no regrets, no matter what happens.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION7|Who is stronger, me or the other Dolls? Commander, I will never lose to those who strive to compromise Griffin's cleanliness.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION6|Commander, I have discovered that a few Dolls are using an illicitly converted Dinergate as a vacuum robot. I would like to file a severe protest.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION5|Commander, please allow me to evict the Dolls who have made a mess in the room.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION4|Commander, all the laundry has been dried in the sun. I hope you'll enjoy your fresh clothing and bedding.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION3|This is Miss Kalina's procurement list, Commander. Please read through it.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION2|Please remember to bring an umbrella if you're going out. According to the weather forecast, it may start raining in a bit.
NPC_Maid|CONTRIBUTION1|Hello, Commander. Is your mission going smoothly?
NPC_Maid|AMUSEMENT|Entertainment? I don't have any hobbies. I'd just like to keep you company...
NPC_Maid|SUPPER|How about some fruit and yogurt for supper? A balanced diet is very important for your health.
NPC_Maid|DINNRER|I have obtained some lovely ingredients from Miss Kalina. Please enjoy your dinner.
NPC_Maid|LUNCH|It's time for lunch. Would you like to eat at the cafeteria, or should I serve your meal here?
NPC_Maid|BREAKFAST|Commander, I'm leaving your breakfast here. Please eat it soon.
NPC_Maid|MIDNIGHT|Commander, out of concern for your health, I advise against staying up too late.
NPC_Maid|EVENING|Good evening, Commander. Here is your coffee. I'll just leave the milk and sugar right next to you.
NPC_Maid|AFTERNOON|Commander, shall I prepare some jam and tea for your afternoon break?
NPC_Maid|NOON|Would you like a midday nap, Commander? Your bed is ready.
NPC_Maid|MORNING|Good morning, Commander. The weather is very nice today – perfect for hanging up the laundry.
NPC_Maid|LOADING|Please wait a moment, Commander. It will be ready soon.
NPC_Maid|TIP|K has sent his maid Marlohe to Griffin to look after the Commander's daily life for the time being.
NPC_Maid|PHRASE|My orders are paramount.
NPC_Maid|CHRISTMAS|Happy Holidays, Commander. I have double-checked all the presents for the Dolls, but there is an extra one... It's for me? Thank you. May I open it right away?
NPC_Maid|ALLHALLOWS|Commander, please stay close to me today. Don't worry, I won't let any candy-stealing monsters near you.
NPC_Maid|TANABATA|Hikoboshi... Haha, I wonder if it's Master K or the Commander? Eeeep?! Commander? I...I was talking in my sleep?
NPC_Maid|VALENTINE|Commander, I have prepared some extra dessert for your afternoon tea today –  chocolate handmade by me. I hope you'll like it.
NPC_Maid|NEWYEAR|Commander, I have followed your instructions and switched your room to homebody mode. Huh? You are planning to stay in throughout the holidays? I know it's New Year, but isn't that a bit too indulgent...?
NPC_Maid|BUILDOVER|Commander, the Doll dormitories are all ready. I'm sure my new colleagues will find their accommodation satisfactory.
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE10|The technicians at Griffin are incredibly skilled at maintenance. The most refreshing part of the week is going to the repair bay for my regular service.
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE9|Commander, p-please do not disturb me while I clean. You are making it very difficult to focus on my work...
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE8|Commander, may I have your permission to use the training ground? I just ran into Miss RO and her friends in the hallway. For the sake of my master's and your safety, I would like to train myself so that I can hold my own against them.
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE7|Master K's room is littered with ashes and cigarette butts. If you don't mind, Commander, please remind him to put out his cigarettes in the ash tray.
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE6|Hm, hm, hmmmmm... Oh?! Commander, you heard that? I...I have a habit humming to myself when I clean. I don't know why, but it makes me happy.
NPC_Maid|DIALOGUE5|Commander, the vase was destroyed by a nefarious Doll that looked like a cat. I am currently dealing with the wreckage, so please give this area a wide berth for the time being.
WKP|GAIN|H-Hello, I'm Wkp. Nice to meet you... Uh, um, should I say anything else? 
WKP|DIALOGUE1|W-What is it? Stop staring at me like that... I-I'm not particularly good at chatting... Please just leave me alone, Commander!
WKP|DIALOGUE2|I have a feeling that I should write to someone, but I can't remember who this someone is and what I should write... So I've been recording what I feel every day. When I finally recall who the recipient is, I'll send them everything. 
WKP|DIALOGUE3|...Do we have to keep chatting? Ugh, Commander, we've been doing this for almost two minutes. I almost can't speak anymore... Can I just listen to you while you talk?
WKP|SOULCONTRACT|Does this mean you're willing to accept my letters...? <>All of them? Unconditionally? Everything about me? <>You'll accept even someone as dull as me, someone who doesn't know how to hold a conversation...?
WKP|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, there's something I want to give you. It's not really a gift... These are all the letters I've written in the past. I think I've found the recipient after all...
WKP|Introduce|H-Hello, I'm Wkp. Nice to meet you... Uh, um, should I say anything else? 
stg940|GAIN|Salutations, Commander. StG-940 reporting for duty. You can call me Wieger, or better yet, make it Big Sis Wieger! ♪
stg940|DIALOGUE1|Commander, I'm trying to say hello to my little sisters and you're in the way. Little ones, wanna play with Big Sis Wieger? Oh, don't run so fast! Be careful not to trip...
stg940|DIALOGUE2|Commander, why are you out strolling at this hour? I see, so you have trouble going to sleep... I'll walk you back, then I'll tell you a bedtime story and stay with you until you fall asleep, okay?
stg940|DIALOGUE3|I'm preparing some presents for my little sisters. I'll be heading out on a mission, after all. They'll surely miss me a lot while I'm not at the base... What? They won't?!
stg940|SOULCONTRACT|I don't make promises easily. To me, oaths are worth keeping even at the cost of everything... <>Do you take your oaths as seriously as I do? <>...Hmm, I believe you, and I would like to keep this one with you.

GSH18Mod|Introduce|Gsh-18, in position! No matter how difficult a problem, I'll solve it with perfection!
GSH18Mod|OPERATIONBEGIN|So it's a long-duration outdoors mission? Then I can get a proper workout.
GSH18Mod|OPERATIONOVER|Commander, I've brought back some nice things.
GSH18Mod|PHRASE|What is it?

BrowningHP|GAIN|This is FN Browning, I salute you. A pleasant breeze blows today, Commander. Why don't we head outside for a stroll before we start working?
BrowningHP|HELLO|Welcome back. How do you feel today?
BrowningHP|FORMATION|Everyone who's going into battle with me today, I'll be in your care.
BrowningHP|FEED|Thank you very much. I feel like I can ride further now.
BrowningHP|DIALOGUE1|Your clothes are wrinkled. Please stay still, let me smooth them out for you. Etiquette is very important even when you're at work.
BrowningHP|DIALOGUE2|No matter how much one loves their work, one will inevitably have moments of frustration. I dislike taking my anger out on people I care about, and the best solution is to go for a ride. What do you think?
BrowningHP|DIALOGUE3|If you're tired, have a little something to drink. You must take care of yourself in order to proceed with your work. What would you like to drink? How about a small piece of cake to go with it?
BrowningHP|BUILDOVER|Commander, we've got a new arrival!
BrowningHP|GOATTACK|Let's go and crush those people who are ruining the mood.
BrowningHP|MEET|You don't even deserve to be the margarine spread on my bread.
BrowningHP|ATTACK|Drive over their faces!
BrowningHP|DEFENSE|It'll be bad if they damage my dress.
BrowningHP|BREAK|You broke my bike, I won't let that slide!
BrowningHP|WIN|Commander, everyone, that was amazing!
BrowningHP|RETREAT|Dammit, this disgusting lot... Next time I'll make sure I smash you all to bits!
BrowningHP|NEWYEAR|It would be a waste not to go out for a ride in weather like this. Don't worry, a true bicycle gangster can run wild even in a fancy dress!
BrowningHP|VALENTINE|Do you have any particular preference for the thickness of your chocolate? I can only give you a fitting present if I understand you completely.
BrowningHP|TANABATA|What kind of wish should I write down... They're all lovely ones. I might as well wish that the god who makes these wishes come true will be happy too.
BrowningHP|ALLHALLOWS|You're saying I look a little pale? I'm sorry, I'm not used to these occasions...that's because I can't tell who's friend or foe. Why don't I change to tranquilizer rounds and put down any suspicious people I see?
BrowningHP|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas, Commander! It's cold today, but the party at night is going to be warm, right? Make sure you come, okay?
BrowningHP|SKILL1|I'll crush you to dust!
BrowningHP|SKILL2|You're dead!
BrowningHP|SKILL3|This shot is key!
BrowningHP|OPERATIONBEGIN|I'll be back soon, don't look down on a bicycle's performance.
BrowningHP|OPERATIONOVER|I'm back, turns out transporting goods by bike is kind of tiring...
BrowningHP|FIX|Please fix my dress along with me.
BrowningHP|COMBINE|Oh my, are you all going to ride pillion? 
BrowningHP|BLACKACTION|Leave it all to me. I won't disappoint you.
BrowningHP|SOULCONTRACT|What's this all about, Commander? <>I see, but I'm not prepared for this. Has our relationship got to such a point? <>Alright, if you're so certain, then I trust your judgment...
BrowningHP|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
BrowningHP|TIP|This is an important reminder, so please take a look.
BrowningHP|LOADING|A moment please.
BrowningHP|DIALOGUEWEDDING|If I can have a cup of tea with my dearest beloved in the secret hideout that I've recently discovered, all my exhaustion from today will be swept away... What say you?
BrowningHP|Introduce|This is FN Browning, I salute you. A pleasant breeze blows today, Commander. Why don't we head outside for a stroll before we start working?
SAF|GAIN|Hola, Commander. I'm SAF, your new subordinate. What a lovely scent... Please give me a hug...
SAF|HELLO|Yay, it's the Commander! Give me today's ration of hugs!
SAF|FORMATION|Relax and leave it to me! If you're worried, then let me hug you...
SAF|FEED|I can feel the weight of the newly-added gear, I hope it doesn't affect my weight too much...
SAF|DIALOGUE1|To me, the Commander's daily hug is as essential as each of my four meals every day!
SAF|DIALOGUE2|Is that you, Commander? Heheh, my eyes are closed, but I can tell it's you from just the scent.
SAF|DIALOGUE3|Hmm... Something feels wrong with the joint on my left leg. I guess I should go get it checked out. Huh? Commander... I'm just doing my routine maintenance. You don't have to yell!
SAF|BUILDOVER|We've got a new friend! Let me see if it's a fresh face or a familiar one♪
SAF|GOATTACK|I hope the enemies don't smell too bad...
SAF|MEET|Ugh, it stinks! I'm having trouble breathing...
SAF|ATTACK|You stinky lot should just disappear!
SAF|DEFENSE|Keep that disgusting smell outside!
SAF|BREAK|The deodorant's all used up...
SAF|WIN|Please give me a hug as a reward!
SAF|RETREAT|Run for it! That smelly bunch is coming at us!
SAF|NEWYEAR|Commander, I made these scented sachets myself. I learned how to do it from the Internet so I don't know if it's right or wrong...but it smells really good!
SAF|VALENTINE|The scent of chocolate fills the air! And it's really strong inside your office, Commander...
SAF|TANABATA|They say that on Tanabata each year, Orihime and Hikoboshi meet on the Magpie Bridge, and below it flows the Milky Way... Say, what do you think the Milky Way smells like?
SAF|ALLHALLOWS|Trick or treat! I knew it was you, I can recognize you even if you change your outfit. Of course, that's because... You smell of candy today...
SAF|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas! Give me upsies for my present! Lift me high enough to touch the top of the Christmas tree!
SAF|SKILL1|I can already smell your blood!
SAF|SKILL2|Savor the taste of fear...
SAF|SKILL3|None of you will escape!
SAF|OPERATIONBEGIN|(Sob) I won't be able to smell you for several days, Commander...
SAF|OPERATIONOVER|I'm back! Please hug me right away!
SAF|FIX|Don't bother! I'll open it up myself...
SAF|COMBINE|Now there's yet another familiar scent...
SAF|BLACKACTION|I hope my teammates don't faint when they see me doing my regular maintenance...
SAF|SOULCONTRACT|Since the first time we met, I've been drawn to your scent... <>It may not be the sweetest scent I have ever smelled, but it's certainly the one that makes me feel the warmest and safest. <>It is an honor that I can have it by my side forever...
SAF|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
SAF|PHRASE|What a lovely smell!
SAF|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Huh? Only a hug today? You lifted me right up yesterday...
SAF|Introduce|Hola, Commander. I'm SAF, your new subordinate. What a lovely scent... Please give me a hug...
Lusa|GAIN|Commander! You look pretty fit, wanna play soccer with me? Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. Pleased to meet you, I'm Lusa! Lusa the soccer player!
Lusa|DIALOGUE1|Coach! Have you heard of the "Black Panther of Soccer"? Uh...no, it's not me. It's a really famous soccer player and my idol! If only I were as good at soccer as he was.
Lusa|DIALOGUE2|Why do I like soccer? Because the ball is right there! ...I'm not a cat! Jeez, you don't understand the beauty of the soccer pitch at all, Commander!
Lusa|DIALOGUE3|I suddenly have an absolutely terrific idea... Say, Commander, why don't you be the coach of Griffin's soccer team?! Huh? D-Don't go! Listen to me—
Lusa|SOULCONTRACT|...A-Are you serious? I thought you summoned me for some kind of secret training, but it's actually for this? <>N-Not that I actually mind... It's just...don't people usually do this after they win a championship? <>Don't think so much? You're right! Thanks, Coach! Keep playing soccer with me, okay?!
Lusa|DIALOGUEWEDDING|(Sobs) I'll definitely win next time. Just you wait, Coach, I'll surely return with the Mules Rimet Trophy!
Lusa|Introduce|Commander! You look pretty fit, wanna play soccer with me? Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. Pleased to meet you, I'm Lusa! Lusa the soccer player!
T5000_0|GAIN|Good day Commander, I'm T-5000... My apologies. If my first impression is too overwhelming then please forget about it.
T5000_0|DIALOGUE1|Don't go to school on an empty belly. Air the comforter when it's sunny. Watch the cars from both directions when crossing the road. Don't rely on other people. And...um... Commander! Don't laugh!
T5000_0|DIALOGUE2|I don't like being at the forefront of everything... Only stupid kids enjoy drawing attention to themselves. But a hero is someone who steps forward when the situation calls for it.
T5000_0|DIALOGUE3|The true identity of Crimson Soul Kamen? I don't know, but does it matter? So long as they have the courage to step forward in a crisis, anyone can be Crimson Soul Kamen!
T5000_0|VALENTINE|My chocolate isn't too special compared to theirs, is it? Mm, this will do.
T5000_0|SOULCONTRACT|Do you want to be Crimson Soul Kamen as well, Commander? It entails responsibilities that not just anyone can shoulder, you know? <>Sheesh, stop pretending to be such a grown-up! <>Alright, take my hand, Commander! Let's fight side-by-side from now on!
T5000_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Crimson Soul Kamen is a hero who defends freedom. The moment they hear a cry for help, they rush over right away and face any challenge fearlessly— C-Commander! There's a cockroach!
T5000_0|Introduce|Good day Commander, I'm T-5000... My apologies. If my first impression is too overwhelming then please forget about it.
TMP_0|GAIN|Co-Commander, pleased to meet you. My name is TMP...pl-please don't look at me like that! I'm begging you...
TMP_0|DIALOGUE1|Hmm... The metal plates sewn into this schoolbag seem pretty sturdy. Maybe I should just use them as protective gear?
TMP_0|DIALOGUE2|Why are these Dinergates so naughty? They fiddled with the bell on my tail again! I'm such a good girl so why is this happening to me...?
TMP_0|DIALOGUE3|I never get tired of this song. The best thing is how the singer embodies "a grown-up's allure" so perfectly. Commander, will I be able to perceive such allure when I grow up?
TMP_0|CHRISTMAS|Another round, AK-47~ hic! ...You were the one who forced me to drink, weren't you~ Don't tell me you can't handle a little bit of alkie? Hahaha~
TMP_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, are you sure you want to enter such an important contract with me right now? <>(Sobs) I-I'm not crying because I'm scared! <>If I was older, I'd be able to handle such an occasion with more dignity!
TMP_0|Introduce|Co-Commander, pleased to meet you. My name is TMP...pl-please don't look at me like that! I'm begging you...
TMP_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|C-Commander... Walk this Dinergate, will you?
X95_0|GAIN|This is wonderful, Commander, we meet at last. I, X95, will give everything I have for you… No, not just for you, for everyone.
X95_0|DIALOGUE1|If a flower does its best to bloom in the wind, even if it's small and insignificant, surely someone will appreciate its beauty, don't you think?
X95_0|DIALOGUE2|Commander, here is my favorite candy and a pretty pebble... I can sense that you aren't very happy. I want to see you smile again...
X95_0|DIALOGUE3|When I become a grown-up like you, will I be able to do more to help everyone, Commander?
X95_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, where would you like me to deliver— It...it's for me? <>Wow...it's a round ring that glitters in the sun... <>Then I'm keeping it. From now on, whenever I touch this ring, I'll think of the gentle smile that's on your lips right now...
EVO3_0|GAIN|Hello, Commander~ Scorpion EVO 3, officially part of the team as of today. Please look after me~
EVO3_0|DIALOGUE1|Commander, I've amended the battle plan for you! Whoa, d-don't rub it off with your eraser! That isn't some random doodle!
EVO3_0|DIALOGUE2|Hmm, Commander, please make Vz.61 keep quiet. I need to get enough sleep or I won't grow properly.
EVO3_0|DIALOGUE3|Don't worry. I may have grown smaller, but I'm still my mature and dignified self. Hmm? There's candy? Where?
EVO3_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander? You want to enter a contract with me? I'm so happy... <>Actually, I've always loved you, Commander. Now I can have you all to myself. <>Heheh, I need to show this to Vz.61 at once. She'll be so jealous!
EVO3_0|Introduce|Hello, Commander~ Scorpion EVO 3, officially part of the team as of today. Please look after me~
EVO3_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, are you resting? You don't often have free time, so come and play with me! Why don't we set off some fireworks together at night? I spent a long time preparing for this.
BrowningHP_0|GAIN|This is FN Browning, I salute you. A pleasant breeze blows today, Commander. Why don't we head outside for a stroll before we start working?
BrowningHP_0|HELLO|Commander! Run faster, I'm already at the finish line!
BrowningHP_0|FORMATION|Hah, everyone's all lined up.
BrowningHP_0|FEED|Taller, faster, prettier~
BrowningHP_0|DIALOGUE1|Let's sneak out for another ride today, Commander! I've got everything ready - both my dress and the bikes!
BrowningHP_0|DIALOGUE2|Tricycles are more stable, but when I grow up, I'm definitely getting a bicycle. Cycling on two wheels IS the way!
BrowningHP_0|DIALOGUE3|Snacks? Tea? Those things can wait till we come back! Hurry, hurry, let's fly!
BrowningHP_0|BUILDOVER|Newbie, go out for a ride with me!
BrowningHP_0|GOATTACK|Let's go! Onward to the dawn!
BrowningHP_0|MEET|Beepbeep — I'm riding, anyone blocking my path will be knocked away!
BrowningHP_0|ATTACK|Go—
BrowningHP_0|DEFENSE|Ehhhhh, it's a red light, better stop.
BrowningHP_0|BREAK|I, I need to bear with this (sobs)
BrowningHP_0|WIN|We can't stop here, we need to keep heading forward!
BrowningHP_0|RETREAT|If we can't keep going, how about next time? Okay?
BrowningHP_0|SKILL1|Guns are so cool!
BrowningHP_0|SKILL2|Chaaaaarge—
BrowningHP_0|SKILL3|Everyone, flatten them!
BrowningHP_0|OPERATIONBEGIN|I'm already prepared for this, can we head out?
BrowningHP_0|OPERATIONOVER|I'm back, I had lots of fun!
BrowningHP_0|FIX|Please fix my dress along with me.
BrowningHP_0|COMBINE|Oh my, are you all going to ride pillion? 
BrowningHP_0|BLACKACTION|Leave it all to me. I won't disappoint you.
BrowningHP_0|SOULCONTRACT|Ahaha, I know what this is - it's proof of our kinship as the rampaging duo, right? <>C'mon, don't be shy. Now that we've exchanged our tokens, don't mince your steps and just get on the bike!
BrowningHP_0|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
BrowningHP_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Hold on, before we go for a ride today, I have a surprise to tell you! I've started learning how to brew tea, and I've even made some dessert! Would you like to try some, Commander?
BrowningHP_0|Introduce|This is FN Browning, I salute you. A pleasant breeze blows today, Commander. Why don't we head outside for a stroll before we start working?
M500Mod|GAIN|Here we go, Dowel. Shout with me, ready... HELLO, COMMANDER!

MAB38Mod|DIALOGUE2|How I've been doing? I'm in a lousy mood... Just pulling your leg. I won't be so frowny all the time anymore. Go ahead and guess how I'm feeling right now, heh.
MAB38Mod|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you need to take care of your health. Here, a mint to boost your blood sugar. Take a short break.

TavorTS12|TANABATA|My wish, hm. My wish is to be able to be calmer this year, to be a little more patient and a little less hot-tempered... This pen's out of ink! What the hell?! This is pissing me off!
TavorTS12|ALLHALLOWS|I prepared a lot of candy. It's going to the people I scare, of course, in case they cry too much.
TavorTS12|CHRISTMAS|Christmas has nothing to do with me, right? I'll just wait outside... Just give me a shout if there's anything which needs doing.

M6ASW|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You can't pack a supply bag like that, let me do it. Also, your cupboard and desk are a mess, at least mark them properly so you can find the necessary items during an emergency... Do you need a diagram?
M6ASW|Introduce|Hang on to this, Commander. It's your survival pack. Come, let's head to the frontline.
MondragonM1908|GAIN|Mondragón reporting, Commander. Please assign me any missions which need to be carried out.
MondragonM1908|HELLO|Commander, the situation in the base today is normal.
MondragonM1908|FORMATION|Please remain silent and listen to my instructions.
MondragonM1908|FEED|My statistics in all areas are showing a distinct improvement. Thank you for your trust, Commander.
MondragonM1908|DIALOGUE1|Commander, please call me "Mond", and not "Ragon"...That form of address upsets me.
MondragonM1908|DIALOGUE2|My apologies, Commander, but I am not given to idle conversation. Unlike those Dolls who gain strength by chatting, every interaction that is not related to the mission only causes me to expend unnecessary energy.
MondragonM1908|DIALOGUE3|Once, I had a strong friend, so strong that I could allow myself to rely on her without any doubts in my heart. But now, due to a tiny, insignificant mistake, she can never return to my side...
MondragonM1908|BUILDOVER|We have a new arrival. I will immediately perform a full inspection and analysis on her.
MondragonM1908|GOATTACK|Fight hard so you may embrace tomorrow.
MondragonM1908|MEET|Forgive me, but I shall be taking your life now.
MondragonM1908|ATTACK|Seize the enemy by the throat.
MondragonM1908|DEFENSE|Do not get lost in the crimson darkness that fills the sky.
MondragonM1908|BREAK|Never mind me, keep fighting.
MondragonM1908|WIN|Our victory belongs to the Commander.
MondragonM1908|RETREAT|Do not lose yourself in battle.
MondragonM1908|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. The sentry rotations for the new year are already on your desk.
MondragonM1908|VALENTINE|Commander, the chocolates which might cause food poisoning when ingested have already been removed. Please enjoy the ones which remain.
MondragonM1908|TANABATA|Violating the laws of the celestial realm and falling in love with a mortal deserves punishment. However, allowing them to meet once a year is too light of a punishment.
MondragonM1908|ALLHALLOWS|Have you finished your daily practice? Don't think I can't recognize you when you have your masks on.
MondragonM1908|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas, Commander. I have punished the girls who played pranks on Santa by assigning them to shovel snow. Please do not go easy on them.
MondragonM1908|SKILL1|I will dispatch you painlessly.
MondragonM1908|SKILL2|Abandon your pointless struggles.
MondragonM1908|SKILL3|Allow me to close your eyes. 
MondragonM1908|OPERATIONBEGIN|We are setting out toward the distance.
MondragonM1908|OPERATIONOVER|Mondragon, returning to unit.
MondragonM1908|FIX|Can I rest a little now...
MondragonM1908|COMBINE|I've made a new breakthrough in combat efficiency. Thank you, Commander.
MondragonM1908|BLACKACTION|This is a simple mission. There is no need to worry.
MondragonM1908|SOULCONTRACT|...I did not expect a gift like this, Commander. <> Thank you for always acknowledging and trusting in me, and thank you for making such a solemn pledge with me. <> Although the future remains an uncertain and illusory thing, I will no longer fear it now that I hold the promise that you have given me.

VPM5|FORMATION|Eh?! Can I really do it?
VPM5|FEED|I'm sorry, I'm not improving much...
VPM5|DIALOGUE1|Although I'd like to do something about my appetite, I won't be able to eat more if I don't improve my digestion modules...right?
VPM5|DIALOGUE2|I'm sorry, I hope I didn't bother you.
VPM5|DIALOGUE3|I often end up retreading old ground because I don't do well enough, but I still don't understand where I'm inadequate, so over time I became less and less confident in myself...
VPM5|BUILDOVER|A new friend has come. She must be amazing, right?
VPM5|GOATTACK|Although I'm not too confident, I'll do my best.
VPM5|MEET|I-In any case, don't be rash. There must be a good way to handle the enemy.
VPM5|ATTACK|This might be a good opportunity to attack, I'll be counting on you.
VPM5|DEFENSE|For some reason I get the feeling that attacking like this isn't a good idea. Let, let's just defend for now.
VPM5|BREAK|(Whimper) Am I still not good enough, Commander? I'm sorry...
VPM5|WIN|This isn't a dream, is it? Did we really win?
VPM5|RETREAT|I'm sorry! I'm sorry! If only I'd done a little better...

VPM5|VALENTINE|Although I was worried that it wouldn't be to your taste, I did my best to make some chocolate for you. I hope you'll accept it, Commander!
VPM5|TANABATA|If I could make a wish, I'd wish that I could become braver... Though that's not too likely.
VPM5|ALLHALLOWS|You want me to dress up as a monster and scare people? I think I'll pass, no matter what I dress up as, I'll be the one being scared in the end. Wait, there's candy? I, er, I think I'll try...
VPM5|CHRISTMAS|Will Santa Claus give me presents? While I'm looking forward to it, I wonder if I'll end up with no presents because I don't perform my daily tasks well enough... Ugh, I'm so worried.
VPM5|SKILL1|Will this work?
VPM5|SKILL2|It doesn't seem very successful...
VPM5|SKILL3|At times like these, if I don't give it my all...
VPM5|OPERATIONBEGIN|I, I think I want to check one more time to see if I forgot something...
VPM5|OPERATIONOVER|I'm sorry, this is all I can do...
VPM5|FIX|I always end up in such a sad state each time...
VPM5|COMBINE|Does this mean...my appetite will grow larger too?
VPM5|BLACKACTION|If we follow the planned route, even I should be able to do it.
VPM5|SOULCONTRACT|...I'm sure my old self would never have imagined that a day like this would come for me. <> I'm still not a very reliable Doll, but whenever I see your eyes, I feel like I can be brave. <> Please let me continue to stay by your side!

VPM5|LOADING|Don't tell me...you had to wait this long because of me?
VPM5|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Recently, I've been experimenting with home cooking. Although I wasn't too confident at first, my efforts have produced some results... Of course, this is my usual portion size, so I'm sure you can... Commander? Did you pass out?
VPM5|Introduce|I, I'm PM5, I hope I won't inconvenience the others...
HK512|GAIN|Hey, Commander, sorry to keep you waiting! I'm 512, where's my welcome party?
HK512|HELLO|You're just in time, Commander! Quick, get on, let's start the new day with a thrilling ride!
HK512|FORMATION|Hello lovely ladies, a new adventure is about to begin...

HK512|DIALOGUE1|Griffin really is a nice place♪ Any Doll gets a chance to fight, no matter their background! Why are you looking at me with those doubting eyes? Did someone say something like that in the past?
HK512|DIALOGUE2|Commander, work must be hard, so try a handmade lunchbox from me! I had to wait a long time before I had the chance to sneak into the kitchen. It's a little big? Well, I did dump half a pot of rice into it...

SUB2000|GAIN|Hello, Commander! Nice to meet you! These two bullets are my generous gift to you.
SUB2000|DIALOGUE1|Good morning, Commander! Now don't stare at me like that. I was just doing my daily awakening routine...
SUB2000|DIALOGUE2|Miss Kalina, are you free at the moment? I've recently come up with a new saving plan, but there are some details that I'm not too sure about, so I thought I'd discuss them with you!
SUB2000|DIALOGUE3|Now stretch out your arms and shift your center of gravity to your hips... Oh dear, got another cramp, Commander? I'll give it a rub for you. By the way, the massage and the lesson are charged separately. ♪
SUB2000|SOULCONTRACT|I know how valuable this ring is, but you're not trying to buy a lifetime's worth of yoga lessons with this, are you?<>It's not exactly good for business, but you have a deal. ♪<> But just so we're clear, other services will cost extra!

Delisle|GAIN|...Hah? Are you talking to me? Are we here already? Are you the Commander? I'm DeLisle, may I know what the bonus scheme here is like?
Delisle|DIALOGUE1|You want to know about my wardrobe? Forget it, you could never learn how I do it, because even I can't replicate the same feeling when I put my clothes on. I basically just throw a little bit of everything together... No, it is NOT homeless fashion!
Delisle|DIALOGUE2|Each brand of earphones is different from the others. The kind I like best are the in-ear types. There's no comparing the peace of mind which in-ear types give me as opposed to over-ear or clip-type earphones... And when you lend one to someone else, you also feel more connected to them.
Delisle|DIALOGUE3|I'm going to beat the crap out of those two bitches next door sooner or later... Their music is crude and tacky and they love surround sound too! Anyone who blasts music out loud must be deaf!
Delisle|SOULCONTRACT|Your taste in Dolls is just as bad as your taste in music... I'll say this up front, if I had to describe myself as a pair of earphones, I'd probably be a 39.90 discount pair. <> If you're okay with that, then I'll do my best for you.
Delisle|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Although tangled earphone cables are annoying, losing either of the left or right channels makes a song incomplete. Even a mess of things thrown together can still become a complete whole, so I'll lend my R to you, and I'll be your L. From now on, we'll be a complete set too.
Delisle|Introduce|...Hah? Are you talking to me? Are we here already? Are you the Commander? I'm DeLisle, may I know what the bonus scheme here is like?
SVCh|GAIN|We meet at last, Commander. I, SVCh, will eliminate all enemies in the backline. Nobody will escape my eyes.
SVCh|DIALOGUE1|If you need long-ranged fire support, please feel free to count on me. You might not know this yet, but SVD has long since become obsolete.
SVCh|DIALOGUE2|Together, KSVK and I would be invincible... Unfortunately, I think I will never get used to someone who speaks as strangely as she does.
SVCh|DIALOGUE3|Don't touch me, Commander, I'm carrying out shooting practice... What? You brought honey dumplings for me? Ahem, well, one should train in moderation. I think it's time to rest for a bit.
SVCh|SOULCONTRACT|What's the matter, Commander? I was just about to go to the range with SVD for a competition. <> This is...hehe, looks like I'm still the winner in the end. <> In that case, please throw a grand celebration for me, one that will not be outdone by anyone else.
SVCh|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You've worked hard, Commander. I made these honey-soaked dumplings just for you. What, you're too lazy to reach out for them? Hehe, so you want me to feed you, then? Hm... Alright, then please open your mouth.
SVCh|Introduce|We meet at last, Commander. I, SVCh, will eliminate all enemies in the backline. Nobody will escape my eyes.

Medusa|OPERATIONBEGIN|Looking at the mission brief, I'll be going somewhere really far away… Jashin-chan and the others will surely miss me. What kind of souvenirs should I bring them, I wonder?
Medusa|OPERATIONOVER|Jashin-chan, I've brought snacks you like— Oh, it's you, Commander…
Medusa|COMBINE|A Dummy that looks exactly like me? Good thing it doesn't have my power of petrifying humans…
Medusa|BLACKACTION|I'll work hard to get stronger!
Medusa|SOULCONTRACT|I'm so unremarkable… A crybaby and a weakling who can't do anything right…<> But you still place your trust in someone like me?<> What an honor… Please keep relying on me like this forever and ever…

Medusa|PHRASE|Jashin-chan, no!
Medusa|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Are you tired from work? You don't actually have to work, Commander… Just take a good rest. Play a game or something, and just leave the rest to me!
Medusa|Introduce|Aaaaaaah! Close your eyes! Don't open them until you've put on this bracelet… Right, it should be safe now. Hello, I'm Medusa…
Yurine|GAIN|Hello, I am Hanazono Yurine. Nice to meet you.
Yurine|HELLO|Welcome home, Commander. I've put together everything that needs to be done today.
Yurine|FORMATION|Alright, I'll take care of these children.
Yurine|FEED|A surge in magicka…? Nothing, I didn't say anything.
Yurine|DIALOGUE1|Commander, you seem a little absent-minded today. If you're in a bad mood, I'll lend you my mandrake root. You see? A mandrake's dying cry is nectar for the soul, don't you agree…?
Yurine|DIALOGUE2|Sorry, Commander, but I'm taking the night off. One of the Dolls lent me a zombie movie of this era and I'm trembling with excitement at just the thought of it…
Yurine|DIALOGUE3|The pudding I put in the fridge is gone… Jashin-chan, that was your doing, wasn't it? This is a perfect chance to test out Griffin's new weaponry. I've never used such tech before! ♪
Yurine|BUILDOVER|A lost child? I'll go and have a look.
Yurine|GOATTACK|All ready? Then let's set off.
Yurine|MEET|I am Dark Xavier, she who delivers the Devil's will to mankind…
Yurine|ATTACK|The timing is perfect. We'll seize this opportunity and attack.
Yurine|DEFENSE|Don't break cover. Enemy fire is growing more intense.
Yurine|BREAK|Dammit… My dress is ruined…
Yurine|WIN|It's finally over… Let's go home.
Yurine|RETREAT|Survival is the most important – this is true for both Dolls and humans.
Yurine|SKILL2|Let me test out my new weapon.
Yurine|SKILL3|Return to the dark, from whence you came…
Yurine|OPERATIONBEGIN|...I have taken note of everything you mentioned, just leave everything to me. This mission will take a while, please keep an eye on Jashin-chan while I'm away.
Yurine|OPERATIONOVER|I'm back. Jashin-chan hasn't got into too much trouble, I hope?
Yurine|FIX|Technology is really advanced in this era. Even human injuries can be treated so quickly…
Yurine|COMBINE|A robot Dummy created in my image that will take damage for me? Well, you have your work cut out for you.
Yurine|PHRASE|Jashin-chan's handiwork again?
Yurine|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Why do you keep staring at me? Make sure you eat properly. Oh right, adding a dash of mayonnaise makes curry rice even tastier. Here, try it.
Minosu|GAIN|I'm Minos. So you're the legendary Commander? Let's have some roast meat to celebrate our meeting!
Minosu|HELLO|Gooooood Mooooorning, Commander! A new day has begun!

Minosu|FEED|That swept away all my exhaustion! I'm feeling up for more work!
Minosu|DIALOGUE1|That's all the work for now, we can go grab a bite. Let's race to the cafeteria, Commander! Whoever comes last has to foot the bill!
Minosu|DIALOGUE2|Commander, got any recommendations for tourist attractions? I've got a friend from Hell who wants to visit. The mortal world changes so quickly, who knows how long these familiar sights will last…?
Minosu|DIALOGUE3|I'm dying for some roast meat. The slightly charred skin glistening with fat, locking in all the juiciness of the flesh… If only there's a "Griffin Roast Meat" food crawl!
Minosu|BUILDOVER|If we don't put our rookies through intensive training, their stamina might not be up to par.
Minosu|GOATTACK|No slacking for today either!!!
Minosu|MEET|Don't spare the enemy, no matter how cute they look!
Minosu|ATTACK|Rooooar! I'm on fire!
Minosu|DEFENSE|I'll show you my unbreakable defenses!
Minosu|BREAK|Hey, hey, hey, are you kidding me?!
Minosu|WIN|Is it over? I'm feeling a bit hungry…
Minosu|RETREAT|Don't force yourselves. Just leave the rest to me.
Minosu|SKILL1|Absolute defense!
Minosu|SKILL2|None of you are getting away!
Minosu|OPERATIONBEGIN|We've got the coordinates of our destination. Now get in the car. All ready? Then we're off!
Minosu|OPERATIONOVER|Commander, we're back! Look, everyone's in my car. Uh, are we missing someone…?
Minosu|FIX|Harder! C'mon, these massage chairs for humans are terribly feeble…
Minosu|COMBINE|So Doll Dummies also have big appetites…
Minosu|BLACKACTION|A new training regimen? Leave it to me!
Minosu|SOULCONTRACT|The Dolls have explained it to me, but I still don't quite get the significance of this ring…<> Still, I do know that it means from now on, we'll always get to eat together!

Minosu|Introduce|I'm Minos. So you're the legendary Commander? Let's have some roast meat to celebrate our meeting!
Pekora|RETREAT|I-I'm still getting my wages, right?
Minosu|SKILL3|Take this and die!
Yurine|BLACKACTION|This is a necessary step for further growth.
Yurine|SOULCONTRACT|I'm not getting this wrong, am I…? Does giving a ring still mean… Even in this era…? <>Are you certain I'm the one? Thank you, I've never had such sentiments declared to me before. <>Then you won't need anyone else by your side other than me, right?
Yurine|Introduce|Hello, I am Hanazono Yurine. Nice to meet you.

Weaver|HELLO|Ouroboros. Starting from today, I'm ready for tougher training.
Weaver|LOADING|You want to know about the inner workings of Sangvis Ferri? You should ask Agent. If you're just looking for something to talk about, perhaps you should ask me about my favorite ice cream flavor.

ARMod|WIN|This was an expected outcome. 
ARMod|RETREAT|Did we fail the mission...
ARMod|SKILL1|Alright, prepare to attack!
ARMod|SKILL2|This is the price of provoking me.
ARMod|SKILL3|What's so great about being light, anyway!

QBU88|MEET|Hurry hurry hurry, switch your formation! Don't drag your feet!
QBU88|NEWYEAR|The preparations for the new year celebrations were only just finished last night. Honestly... If I'd known they were so slow, I would have asked you to let me handle it instead.
QBU88|OPERATIONBEGIN|Hurry up or we'll not make it to the limited-time sale at the mall!
QBU88|OPERATIONOVER|The loot's all here, Commander. I have something else to do so I'll make a move first!

QBU88|TIP|Follow me!
QBU88|VALENTINE|Although I always prioritize value for money when I go shopping, you can't be too stingy on a day like this. Commander, you feel the same way, don't you?
QBU88|WIN|The outcome was as I expected... Oh yes, don't forget to bag up the trophies!
PP19Mod|DIALOGUE2|What are you looking at, Commander? Want to arm wrestle with me? I'll control my strength so you don't get hurt.

RexZero1|FORMATION|I'm very experienced with this. Come with me.
RexZero1|FEED|I'm stronger than before.
RexZero1|DIALOGUE1|You think I'm wearing too many accessories on my head? They're all gifts from people I've helped. The two flowers are from my previous boss; this pin badge is from VHS; this round one is from AUG Para; the ribbon is from Tabuk...
RexZero1|DIALOGUE2|Griffin has so little restrictions on our attire. My previous workplace didn't permit such casual clothing. Still, don't you look all prim and proper, Commander?
RexZero1|DIALOGUE3|Is something bothering you? Let me help. I may not look it, but I'm pretty experienced in solving tough problems.
RexZero1|BUILDOVER|A colleague is reporting for duty, I'll go get her.
RexZero1|GOATTACK|You guys don't look like you're offline. Are you suspects? 
RexZero1|MEET|Hurry and overwhelm the enemy so we can minimize friendly casualties!

RexZero1|VALENTINE|I'm quite experienced when it comes to teaching people how to make chocolate. See, these are all the thank-you gifts my students have given me.
RexZero1|TANABATA|Making wishes? I'm good at making other people's wishes come true, but if I had to make a wish for myself... Here, I'll give you this tanzaku instead so you can make an extra wish.
RexZero1|ALLHALLOWS|Chaos tends to break out at times like these. This isn't me worrying too much, but the voice of experience speaking. You should be careful too, Commander.
RexZero1|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas, Commander! Want to go give out presents together? You look just like Santa Claus in your outfit so there's no need to change.
RexZero1|SKILL1|Concentrate your fire!
RexZero1|SKILL2|Someone's going to pay for this shot.
RexZero1|SKILL3|Trade yourself for my bullets.
RexZero1|OPERATIONBEGIN|I might be back a little late, don't worry.
RexZero1|OPERATIONOVER|I'm sorry, am I still on time? There were a lot of people who needed help, but I also brought back a lot of extra things.
RexZero1|FIX|I've worried you, Commander... How would you like me to pay you back?
RexZero1|COMBINE|This means I'll be able to handle multiple requests at once. Huh? It doesn't work that way?

RexZero1|Introduce|Rex Zero 1, ready to serve. How can I be of service?
SACR|GAIN|Finally! No human has ever kept me waiting for so long!
SACR|HELLO|Did you notice anything different about the base today? Hey! I didn't break anything, you know!
SACR|FORMATION|It can't be helped, I guess I'll just have to show you a fraction of my skills.
SACR|FEED|It certainly feels good, but do you think I really need to get stronger?
SACR|DIALOGUE1|Rain...is the most annoying thing EVER! Because there's this darn troublemaker who has the habit of running around whenever it rains and you simply can't get a hold of her!
SACR|DIALOGUE2|I do enjoy our conversations, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to give my life for you! So you'd better watch out for your own safety on the battlefield...
SACR|DIALOGUE3|If there's something you wanna do, do it at once! Otherwise, if you miss the opportunity, you'll regret it so much you'll shove 30 slices of Sachertorte down your throat!
SACR|BUILDOVER|Is there a newcomer? I hope they're good at making repairs.
SACR|GOATTACK|Charge! Kill them all and let none survive!

SACR|WIN|Humph, I won with barely any effort, how boring.
SACR|RETREAT|Remember this... The next time we meet will be your doomsday!
SACR|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. Ahhhhh, what a pain! Big Sis insisted that I come here and tell you that. Alright, now that I've said it... Here, this is for you. It's just some old thing that I bought, don't let your imagination run wild!
SACR|VALENTINE|Big Sis made this chocolate, and I'm giving it to you. What? That AUG, why did she go and write my name on the chocolate!? I, I would never do something as lame and childish as that...
SACR|TANABATA|Commander, why did you come to my personal private stargazing site? What's so good about looking at the Milky Way, anyway? It's nothing compared to my smile — A-Ahem, I, I didn't say anything!
SACR|ALLHALLOWS|Trick or treat! Give me more candy, Commander, this much isn't enough for me to share with my big sis...
SACR|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas, Commander. Why are you staring at my gift, your present's already on your table...
SACR|SKILL1|This is the fate of those who annoy me!
SACR|SKILL2|The tears of the weak deserve no sympathy!
SACR|SKILL3|Rip and scatter, like crimson petals!
SACR|OPERATIONBEGIN|Oh, don't look at me with those puppy-dog eyes, I'll be back once I finish this mission.
SACR|OPERATIONOVER|Everything went well, everyone came back safely, and our spoils have been handed over to the warehouse.
SACR|FIX|Dammit, I won't forgive anyone who hurts me...
SACR|COMBINE|My demolition team has grown stronger...
SACR|BLACKACTION|Yes, yes, I know, relax and wait in the base for me to return.
SACR|SOULCONTRACT|Oh, c'mon! It took you so long to spit it out, so this is what you want to talk to me about... <>I'm don't make commitments easily, but since you're so sincere, I'll take this Oath with you. <>From now on, um, I...won't destroy your stuff anymore...

SACR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Don't look at me so suspiciously! I-I wasn't planning to destroy your chair. I just...saw that you didn't find this chair very comfortable to sit on, so I modified it a bit...
SACR|Introduce|Finally! No human has ever kept me waiting for so long!
M1897Mod|SKILL1|Now!
VSK|GAIN|VSK-94, reporting for duty. So, you're my boss? Nice to meet you.
VSK|HELLO|Ah, Boss, you've arrived for work?
VSK|FORMATION|Do I have to lead four troublemakers around again...
VSK|FEED|That was a pretty good experience.
VSK|DIALOGUE1|...A complaint letter from a human? Accusing me of trying to kidnap human children? Sorry, but that wasn't me. I worked many years at a police station. Why would I commit such a low-life crime?
VSK|DIALOGUE2|I don't have any special interests. I'm often in the vicinity of the kindergarten because...I just so happen to be passing by. But how do you know about that, Boss? If you don't answer, I'll have to cuff and interrogate you...
VSK|DIALOGUE3|Seeing something that you shouldn't, touching something that you shouldn't. Both are punishable crimes, don't you think, Boss?
VSK|BUILDOVER|The new arrival has reported in, Boss.
VSK|GOATTACK|Let's go, think of it as an after-dinner walk.
VSK|MEET|So these are the guys you bring with you when you come out?
VSK|ATTACK|Follow me and attack!
VSK|DEFENSE|Maintain your defence!
VSK|BREAK|Don't get too cocky, this is just the beginning.
VSK|WIN|I can't think of any other ending besides this one.
VSK|RETREAT|Did... Did I fail?
VSK|NEWYEAR|Yo, Boss, Happy New year. I heard we get double pay if we do overtime on the new year... So were you thinking of trying to get one past me by acting dumb? Don't even think about it.
VSK|VALENTINE|So today is Valentine's Day, no wonder the other Dolls on base are so excited. Valentine's Day is when crimes of passion tend to peak, so I'll be extra vigilant on my patrols.
VSK|TANABATA|They say that every year, on this day, a bridge of magpies forms in the heavens to let a man and a woman meet, is that right? Boss, isn't this a violation of animal protection law?
VSK|ALLHALLOWS|You dressed up as monsters to attack me and steal my candy, do you know what kind of crime that is? Don't worry, I'll slap you in cuffs and we can have a nice long chat back at the station...
VSK|CHRISTMAS|I've already applied for leave, Boss. That's because the day I look forward to most in the entire year is the day when I can dress up as Santa and give kids presents.
VSK|SKILL1|Enjoy the pain of your life ebbing away.
VSK|SKILL2|You have nowhere to run.
VSK|SKILL3|This is a boring battle.
VSK|OPERATIONBEGIN|Will I have to hang around so many Dolls for an extended period of time? What a headache. May I remove their voice modules before we set out?
VSK|OPERATIONOVER|I'm back, Boss. Oh, don't give me that nervous look, I wouldn't do anything as violent as scrapping my teammates.
VSK|FIX|Finally, the world is quiet for a moment.
VSK|COMBINE|Now that there's another me around, does that mean I should be paid an extra salary?
VSK|BLACKACTION|Leave that to me.
VSK|SOULCONTRACT|Why do humans like to use this kind of delicate ring as a token of affection? <>Since it's your custom, I'll respect and follow it. <>In return, I'm giving you these handcuffs. They're much sturdier than your flimsy ring.
VSK|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
VSK|PHRASE|Taste the wrath of justice.
VSK|DIALOGUEWEDDING|There aren't any nice stories from my past. Most of them were filled with sorrow and despair because I kept losing the ones I wanted to protect. But this time, I won't let that happen again.
VSK|Introduce|VSK-94, reporting for duty. So, you're my boss? Nice to meet you.
R5RGP|ALLHALLOWS|I always prepare lots of candy at this time every year... But nobody ever visits me for trick-or-treating. I wonder why...
R5RGP|ATTACK|Prestissimo!
R5RGP|BLACKACTION|The audience is all here. Now enjoy our performance!
R5RGP|BREAK|(Groan) The rhythm's all messed up now...
R5RGP|BUILDOVER|Our new friend is ready, didn't you hear the echoes?
R5RGP|CHRISTMAS|They're looping a Christmas song over the PA system. It sounds nice, but it seems a little monotonous... Commander, want to hear a different version of it?
R5RGP|COMBINE|Are you on drums? Bass? Keyboard? I won't give up my spot as lead vocal!
R5RGP|DEFENSE|Grave!
R5RGP|DIALOGUE1|I heard some really obscure heavy metal music when I was on my way to the café, but there was nothing but a mess by the time I got there. I wonder who was listening to it...
R5RGP|DIALOGUE2|The pearl can only see the whole world when it's taken out from its shell. Can you hear the sound of rock from the shell casings?
R5RGP|DIALOGUE3|While I was still in the factory, my creator believed that I could surpass all my predecessors of the same model and had high hopes for me. If I couldn't live up to these expectations, I'd despise myself.
R5RGP|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Want to hear my new song? ...Yeah, I wrote it just for you. This was the first time I felt so nervous about creating music. I just hope you'll like it.
R5RGP|FEED|My strings...are wound tighter now.
R5RGP|FIX|The G string pitch is a little abnormal...
R5RGP|FORMATION|A score can only be played when each and every note on it is in harmony. That being the case, I would be the most important chord.
R5RGP|GAIN|Remington R5... I was created with high expectations. As for whether I deserve them, you'll have to see what I'm worth with your own eyes.
R5RGP|GOATTACK|The concert's about to begin... Everyone, let them hear our song!
R5RGP|HELLO|You came just in time, I had a sudden burst of inspiration, so would you like me to hum a tune for you? ...Before that, though, what's today's schedule like?
R5RGP|Introduce|Remington R5... I was created with high expectations. As for whether I deserve them, you'll have to see what I'm worth with your own eyes.
R5RGP|LOADING|My strings aren't tuned yet... Give me a while more, Commander.
R5RGP|MEET|Let's go, the audience is ready and waiting!
R5RGP|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year! Commander, I'll be in your care for this coming... I'm being too earnest? But of course I am! 
R5RGP|OPERATIONBEGIN|I'll leave my guitar with you for now, help me look after it.
R5RGP|OPERATIONOVER|Hey! Where's my guitar? ...I really want to play it.
R5RGP|PHRASE|Get it!
R5RGP|RETREAT|Our next performance will be more exciting...
R5RGP|SKILL1|Pulling-off!
R5RGP|SKILL2|Sweep-picking!
R5RGP|SKILL3|And then... BOOM!
R5RGP|SOULCONTRACT|You want to shackle my finger, which I play music with? <>Surely you understand what that entails, right, Commander...? <>Right, of course, I know that perfectly well... Then finally, have I lived up to your expectations?
R5RGP|TANABATA|I wrote a new score, would you mind listening to me play it? ...It might be a little long, so listening to all of it might take the whole day. After that, we can look at the stars together.
R5RGP|TIP|Listen up!
R5RGP|VALENTINE|Chocolate? Of course I didn't make any, what if I hurt my fingers? ...However, I did buy some candy at the store earlier, so I'll give you half of them.
R5RGP|WIN|Perfect! That was flawless performance!
88typeMod|ATTACK|Honestly! Don't just walk all over the place!
88typeMod|BREAK|Ugh! ...Master's going to scold me now!
88typeMod|BUILDOVER|A warm welcome to our new staffer! ...Huh? She's a new customer? Really?
88typeMod|DEFENSE|Please stay here and wait. 
88typeMod|DIALOGUE1|Does this getup look odd? No? That's great. Wearing it fills me with nostalgia.
88typeMod|DIALOGUE2|I'll pamper your taste buds at the store and ensure your safety when we're out! I had regrets in the past, but they've only made me stronger.
88typeMod|DIALOGUE3|I have calculated how to converse with you many times, Master... But I guess I just can't help but feel flustered around you.
88typeMod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Thank you... No, I'm not just being polite. I can't help but express my gratitude just looking at you, Master.
88typeMod|FEED|I can really feel myself growing! Thank you, Master!

88typeMod|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas! Master, are you participating in the store events? You might just win a special Christmas gift.
88typeMod|SOULCONTRACT|So what would you like this time, Master?<>Huhhh? Me...? A-Alright. But make sure you take good care of me...<>Umm... So this time, I'm yours.
88typeMod|WIN|It seems the customers were very pleased this time round. Let's give them good service next time too!

RO635Mod|DIALOGUE3|Peaceful days like this don't come by often... No Dolls with their heads stuck in strange places, no animal hordes escaping the Rescue Station, and no tricky emergency missions... I'm actually not too used to this.

VHS|HELLO|Is it time for work already? Hang on, let me put these away.
VHS|FORMATION|I'm not good at teamwork... But I guess I'll have to try.
VHS|FEED|There is a meaning in becoming strong.
VHS|DIALOGUE1|If you're at a loss for how to handle a situation, don't try to force the issue and get lost in trivial details. That will only lead to tunnel vision on your part. Instead, you should try doing something else. How about a 32-sided Rubik's Cube?
VHS|DIALOGUE2|I may like playing with these things, but please stop trying to force me to make up with Gr SL8, because I have no intention of forgiving her. Hanging out with people who are too boisterous only serves to disturb my thoughts, as she has clearly demonstrated.
VHS|DIALOGUE3|My standards for a friend? Hm... They need to be quiet, efficient, able to do their own thing even if we're in the same room and not disturb each other. In other words, like FAMAS.
VHS|BUILDOVER|Be quiet when you come out. I'm building a model.
VHS|GOATTACK|Let's go. Advance carefully.

VHS|NEWYEAR|Oh come on, give me a break, is there nowhere today that I can be at peace? Happy New Year, Commander, let me duck into your room for a bit.
VHS|VALENTINE|I learned how to make chocolate, so that's simple enough. Do you want some? Okay, help me build this model and I'll make some for you.
VHS|TANABATA|I wish I had a private space that followed me around and which I could enter for some peace and quiet whenever I wanted to be alone. Ah, in other words, I should get a sleeping bag.
VHS|ALLHALLOWS|So once I make myself up to be a little scary-looking and sit here, I'll be able to avoid the vast majority of social interactions? No, I don't have a phobia of social interactions, I just feel that they're unnecessary.
VHS|CHRISTMAS|What do you want? It's not often that we have a festival where we can make and fulfil each other's wishes. If it's within my power to give, I'll make sure to satisfy you.

AR57|FORMATION|I hope we'll be able to get along this time...
AR57|FEED|Oh, it's nothing... It's a hobby for me anyway.
AR57|DIALOGUE1|I know my face looks a little fierce... But I was rolled out of the factory this way, it's not like I decided it, right? Calling me a battle maniac just because of that is a little unfair, don't you think... You want me to stop pointing my gun around? No can do.
AR57|DIALOGUE2|This has been bothering me for a while now... You've got terrible taste in clothes, Commander. If I let my pet dog wear an outfit like this it would cry, you know? The next time we have a chance... Let's go shopping together.

AR57|RETREAT|I'll let you off for now...
AR57|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander... Why are you dressed like this at the start of a new year? Honestly, I don't know what I'm going to do with you. Forget it, let's go. Today I'll take you to buy some fashionable clothing. You need a new look for the new year, after all.
AR57|VALENTINE|Handmade chocolate? Don't be silly, how could an amateur make something that tastes better than what you could buy in shops? If I had the energy to spare for that, I'd rather work several part-time jobs and then buy some high-class chocolate that caught my eye... Therefore, I'm going to beat you up if you say it tastes bad.
AR57|TANABATA|I don't have any wishes in particular that I'd like to make. If I had to answer, I'd say that I wish I could have a gentler look on my face... You wish my wish won't come true? Are you looking for a fight?
AR57|ALLHALLOWS|I hate Halloween. Why? It's because I prepare a pile of candy each time, but nobody comes to prank me. The brats go around me when they see me and in the end I have to eat them all by myself... This year? Of course I prepared candy too. Want to share some with me?
AR57|CHRISTMAS|What are you doing hiding in the office at Christmas? Don't you have something to do for the occasion? The dinner party? That's at night, right? Do people actually not have dates for Christmas? Honestly... Ah, come on. Let's go have some fun somewhere before the party. This is Christmas, you know.
AR57|SKILL2|So what if I'm fierce?!
AR57|SKILL3|Is it wrong to take my job seriously?!
AR57|OPERATIONBEGIN|You really have guts to be making me to do this sort of thing... You'd better remember this.
AR57|OPERATIONOVER|I'm so tired... I want to hurry up and take a bath.
AR57|FIX|You can fix clothes too? That's great!
AR57|COMBINE|Hmm... Yeah, I DO look kind of mean...
AR57|BLACKACTION|I'll make a move first, then.
AR57|TIP|Tactics? Go ahead.
AR57|LOADING|Commander, what is that you're wearing? Can't you change into something else?
AR57|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Recently, I've been starting to think that it doesn't matter if people think I look fierce. I mean, everyone will come to know the real me eventually, so I kind of feel like I've been kind of a dork for worrying about it all this time... Now whose fault do you think it is, hm?
AR57|Introduce|Tactical Doll AR57 reporting... Why are you standing so far away? It's not like I'm going to do anything to you...
FX05|GAIN|I am Xiuhcoatl, and I'm looking forward to receiving orders from the Griffin and Kryuger PMC! Now then, what's my first order?
FX05|HELLO|Ah, Commander! Welcome!
FX05|FORMATION|Let's work together, everyone~
FX05|FEED|Very good, very good~ Is there more?
FX05|DIALOGUE1|I write down many things in my notebook. That way I won't forget them. However, there's no time to read books on the battlefield, which is quite vexing...
FX05|DIALOGUE2|This is how you spell the name of that officer from yesterday. it's 30 characters long, but it's much easier to remember than daily events.
FX05|DIALOGUE3|You're amazing for being able to remember so many things, Commander. Is this your secret to winning people over?
FX05|BUILDOVER|Awesome! Is this a new friend or a familiar face?
FX05|GOATTACK|Move out! Where's the target?
FX05|MEET|I don't think we were asked to leave anyone alive, right?
FX05|ATTACK|Nobody said anything about retreat! Fight!
FX05|DEFENSE|They told us to defend...right?
FX05|BREAK|Looks like all I can to is cheer you guys on...
FX05|WIN|What a wonderful battle! Commander, want to hear me sing a song?
FX05|RETREAT|My notebook doesn't say anything about an operation like this...
FX05|NEWYEAR|This is a day for singing, listening to songs, and visiting friends! Commander, where are we going first?
FX05|VALENTINE|There ought to be lots of chocolates on the day commemorating St. Valentine... Commander, did you see the chocolate recipe that I left here just now?
FX05|ALLHALLOWS|I know where all these monsters come from, don't you have a new challenge for me? 
FX05|CHRISTMAS|Today's weather is lovely, but I still have a few friends who haven't received gifts yet. Now who did I just give presents to...
FX05|SKILL1|Everyone, charge!
FX05|SKILL2|Together as one!
FX05|SKILL3|Let us march toward victory together!
FX05|OPERATIONBEGIN|Alright, I've finished making the list. See you later~
FX05|OPERATIONOVER|I've brought these things back, hopefully they'll come in useful.
FX05|FIX|Is everyone alright? Does it hurt? I'm alright.
FX05|COMBINE|How lively, let's play a piece together~
FX05|BLACKACTION|Leave it to me, I've memorized it.
FX05|SOULCONTRACT|I don't think I've forgotten anything, right? My memory's been pretty good recently... <> An oath? With you? <> How wonderful! Of course I'd be willing to make an oath with someone like yourself!
FX05|PHRASE|Oh dear!
FX05|MOOD1|Heehee.
AR57|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
RPK203|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
FX05|MOOD2|Oh my...
FX05|APPRECIATE|So it was you.
FX05|ACCEPT|Mm~mm!
FX05|TIP|I think writing these down should be helpful...
FX05|LOADING|Wait a minute, Commander, now where are the instructions for opening the door...
FX05|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Honestly! There's got to be a limit to how kindhearted you are! Granted, it's a good thing, but I get bothered when you keep looking at other people! At the very least you should take me along to help out.
FX05|Introduce|I am Xiuhcoatl, and I'm looking forward to receiving orders from the Griffin and Kryuger PMC! Now then, what's my first order?
PPD40|GAIN|Hello, Commander, PPD-40 reporting. Let me get this out of the way first, the one thing I hate most in the world is people dumping last-minute overtime on me. You're not that sort of boss, are you?
PPD40|HELLO|One should begin a lovely day with a spoonful of black caviar and a glass of vodka. 
PPD40|FORMATION|You'd better listen to me if you want to come back in one piece,.
PPD40|FEED|Ah, it feels great to set money on fire.
PPD40|DIALOGUE1|Do you like my cherry dangle? Here, I'll give you one. Don't worry, it's just a synthetic gemstone. I gave Papasha a few so she'd take off that plastic stuff of hers, but she said she couldn't bear to wear them...
PPD40|DIALOGUE2|Although I was prepared for this before I come here, the dorm conditions here are... Having a Doll like myself live in such a place is like serving caviar on silver-plated cutlery.
PPD40|DIALOGUE3|Commander, is the progress on your work not going well? If you're not in a good mood, then why not put down your work and have afternoon tea with me?
PPD40|BUILDOVER|I hope this one has a touch of class.
PPD40|GOATTACK|The sooner we call it  a day, the sooner we get to go back and enjoy life.
PPD40|MEET|Let's take care of this ASAP so it doesn't delay my quitting time.
RPK203|SKILL2|Don't think you'll get your way!
PPD40|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
PPD40|ATTACK|Let the enemy witness our firepower!
PPD40|DEFENSE|Humph, that's all there is to them.
PPD40|BREAK|...This, this is impossible!
PPD40|WIN|Perfect, we finished just before knocking off from work.
PPD40|RETREAT|We just met the enemy at the wrong time.
PPD40|VALENTINE|Here, this is black truffle chocolate, my favorite. Is it handmade? Of course not. While I understand the feelings that go into making handmade items, I feel that personally buying expensive gifts better expresses one's emotions.
PPD40|TANABATA|Orihime sure is amazing, I can't believe she can endure crossing that stinky bridge of magpies... If it were me, I'd break up with Hikoboshi on the spot.
PPD40|ALLHALLOWS|Please close the door, Commander. It took me a lot of effort to find a place where I could drink in peace. If those troublemakers outside found out, my last bastion of solace would be gone too.
PPD40|CHRISTMAS|Ah, it's you, Commander. Merry Christmas. I'm preparing gifts for those two. We're sisters, after all, so I need to discharge my sisterly obligations even if I dislike them, don't I?
PPD40|SKILL2|You strength is laughable.
PPD40|SKILL3|Open your eyes and face reality!
PPD40|OPERATIONBEGIN|I wonder if I'll find a chef who can make minced chicken cakes during this outing?
PPD40|OPERATIONOVER|Unfortunately, I didn't get my wish, but I did get a lot of special acquisitions...
PPD40|FIX|The more intricate the Doll, the more carefully you need to — hey! Quit messing up my hair!
PPD40|COMBINE|Looks like my clothing expenses are going up, huh...
PPD40|BLACKACTION|You're letting me handle everything? Truly a wise choice.
PPD40|PHRASE|Girls Frontline.
PPD40|TIP|You think I'm too stern at work? Humph, how else could I motivate this bunch of slackers?
PPD40|LOADING|Be patient, you will gain something of equal value to the time you spent waiting.
PPD40|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, did you duck in here to slack off again? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scold you! I just... I think that perhaps I have a lot to learn when it comes to honestly expressing my concern.
PPD40|Introduce|Hello, Commander, PPD-40 reporting. Let me get this out of the way first, the one thing I hate most in the world is people dumping last-minute overtime on me. You're not that sort of boss, are you?
SIGMCX|GAIN|Yo, Commander. Let's get along from now on.
SIGMCX|HELLO|What do you have lined up for today? Want to play a round...?
SIGMCX|FORMATION|Turns out I'm essential after all.
SIGMCX|FEED|Oh my, I've gone from very strong to even stronger.
SIGMCX|DIALOGUE1|Hm? Are you mad? Wonderful, you look much more lively now. Being listless and all doesn't suit you.
SIGMCX|DIALOGUE2|Let me know if you've got any problems or difficulties. After all, I AM a cop of sorts.
SIGMCX|DIALOGUE3|Having only one mood is very bad for the body, you know. How about playing a game with me? That way you can experience the extreme emotional fluctuations of winning and losing.
SIGMCX|BUILDOVER|One more person who can take part in my little game.
SIGMCX|GOATTACK|I've been ready for a while. Let's move out.
SIGMCX|MEET|Oh dear, we've discovered the enemy.
SIGMCX|ATTACK|We're ready, we ought to be charging them now.
SIGMCX|DEFENSE|Relax, defending is more important for now.
SIGMCX|BREAK|I think this game went a little overboard...
SIGMCX|WIN|Ah, I don't think I used my full strength.
SIGMCX|RETREAT|This is also a form of progress from a different point of view.
SIGMCX|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander! Won't you give me a red packet as a show of friendship?
SIGMCX|VALENTINE|Yo, today's a good day for a multi-player game. Not interested, Commander? Relax, it's just an ordinary game of poker.
AR57|SKILL1|Go on, call me fierce!
AR57|SOULCONTRACT|Sheesh, you really have a lot of courage to be saying this sort of thing to me... <> Don't you think I'm fierce? You do? Then why are you still... <> ...Well, yeah, you have a point. Being able to accept something like that is a sign of true acceptance, right? <> In that case, please take care of me, Commander.
AR57|PHRASE|Don't be stupid.
SIGMCX|TANABATA|Didn't Hikoboshi bring two kids to meet Orihime on the magpie bridge? That makes a full table of four for a proper game of poker.
SIGMCX|ALLHALLOWS|The essence of true pranking is lost when your intentions are written all over your face.  (Sigh) In the end, you still need me for that sort of thing.
RPK203|LOADING|Only careful preparation will allow you to deal with any unexpected occurrence during the course of a mission.
SIGMCX|CHRISTMAS|Commander, I've thought of what I want for a present. Why not give me a new poker deck? Ideally, the cards would be made of titanium alloy, but if you think that's too heavy a regular alloy will do, I'm not picky.
SIGMCX|SKILL1|Pull yourself together, battle is a very intense game.
SIGMCX|SKILL2|Oh, don't be so grim. With me around we're sure to win.
SIGMCX|SKILL3|Let's add a bit of excitement.
SIGMCX|OPERATIONBEGIN|I love going to new places. Cuties with no sense of wariness are the best for roping into games.
SIGMCX|OPERATIONOVER|Oh, how time flies.
PPD40|GAIN|Hello, Commander, PPD-40 reporting. Let me get this out of the way first, the one thing I hate most in the world is people dumping last-minute overtime on me. I'm sure you're not that kind of boss, right?
PPD40|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. My new year's wish is a higher salary and less work, have you thought about helping to make it come true?
PPD40|SKILL1|You bastards keeping me from knocking off can all go to hell!
PPD40|SOULCONTRACT|Although this ring does fit me very well, I hear that the ring has a very deep-rooted meaning behind it. <> Have you really thought this through, Commander? <> It looks like our answers are the same. That being the case, I will take responsibility for your future until the very end.
SIGMCX|FIX|Don't let it bother you too much, I won't get mad even if you forget the poker cards somewhere. At most, we'll just start all over again.
SIGMCX|COMBINE|The joy of joking around is going to be multiplied.
SIGMCX|BLACKACTION|Messing up is also kind of fun... Don't be scared, I was just kidding.
SIGMCX|SOULCONTRACT|There is a kind of game that can only be played by two people, and this ring seems to be a representation of that game. Once you put it on, it seems you'll be bound into a certain kind of relationship. <> Are you sure you want to do this? Oh my, it looks like I'll need to get used to your presence in all my future games.
SIGMCX|PHRASE|Want to guess what card this is?
XM8|VALENTINE|I made a chocolate chess set. Let's have a game — but you have to physically eat the pieces you take.
SIGMCX|TIP|What does it mean to be reserved? That word doesn't exist in my dictionary. Speaking of which, there's been a new game going around recently...
SIGMCX|LOADING|What a game tests is your mental state. You aren't in such a hurry, are you?
SIGMCX|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, come quick, I just thought of a new way to play cards! Hehe, don't think you can run away, I designed it to include you from beginning to end, you know~
SIGMCX|Introduce|Yo, Commander. Let's get along from now on.
RPK203|GAIN|I am RPK-203, officially joining the unit from today onward. It would be an honor to share relevant combat experience with everyone.
RPK203|HELLO|Commander... Um, judging by the look on your face, I take it you've finished digesting the combat reports I submitted earlier?
RPK203|FORMATION|Is everyone present?
RPK203|FEED|Yup, it's worth recording!
RPK203|DIALOGUE1|You really are a charismatic leader like the rumors say... The kind who doesn't care about the consequences in various ways. Do you want me to elaborate? You'll find out soon enough.
RPK203|DIALOGUE2|I deeply admire Miss Kalina. After all, her speed at writing combat reports is second to none... Don't you want me to learn from her?
RPK203|DIALOGUE3|When working you need to be 120% motivated. That is the fundamental of all fundamentals, and as a Commander you should set an example and correct the mood in the base.
RPK203|BUILDOVER|As for the circumstances of the newcomers, I will inform you by way of a report.
RPK203|GOATTACK|I sincerely hope that this operation will become an exciting part of our CVs.
RPK203|MEET|Maintain formation and prepare to repel the enemy!
RPK203|ATTACK|The intense fighting has only just begun, don't slack off!
RPK203|DEFENSE|Defend this place to the last at all costs!
RPK203|BREAK|I will remember this humiliation well.
RPK203|WIN|It seems I can put that into the combat report. 
RPK203|RETREAT|Looks like it's time to write a self-reflection essay.
RPK203|NEWYEAR|Hoping for everything to start over from the beginning and the like is nothing more than a pretty-sounding wish. Please take steps which are rooted in practicality. The work that has been accumulated until now will not permit you to slack off, and if this keeps up, you run the risk of getting a visit from a scary little bear.
RPK203|VALENTINE|"A chocolate combat report?" Of course I won't make anything of the sort. However, "chocolates and combat reports" have been waiting on your desk for a while now, so make sure you collect them.
RPK203|TANABATA|My greatest wish is that everyone will diligently improve themselves, and that you will become the capable commander that I have in my heart...though that will depend on your future performance.
RPK203|ALLHALLOWS|Regarding the mission of dressing up as a plush teddy bear mascot and giving out candy, that will naturally be your job. I'm sure the kids will love it.
RPK203|CHRISTMAS|You want to give me a Christmas present? A little teddy bear will do... Please don't worry, I'd be quite frustrated if I didn't get a present like that in the end.
RPK203|SKILL1|Simple suppression!
RPK203|SKILL3|Carve this lesson into your hearts!
RPK203|OPERATIONBEGIN|I will give my all towards bringing back a harvest.
RPK203|OPERATIONOVER|The squad has already rested and recovered. We're ready to move out again anytime.
RPK203|FIX|I hope I can get back to the frontlines soon...
RPK203|COMBINE|You do realize that at this rate, the number of people supervising you is going to be multiplied as well, don't you?
RPK203|BLACKACTION|I will bring you the best outcome.
RPK203|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, this is...a combat report which I must give you in person. <> Rather than being surprised, why not open it up right away and see what's inside? <> You should know that what this report contains, is the entirety of me.
RPK203|PHRASE|Some things don't need to be said to one's face.
RPK203|TIP|Why I give out little teddy bears? Don't you think that the idea of an innocent exterior concealing a mysterious power is very exciting?
RPK203|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is there no more space for teddy bears at home? Well, it can't be helped, recently everyone looks like they've been doing very well... You don't think so? Could it be that my keen sight is being influenced by something?
RPK203|Introduce|I am RPK-203, officially joining the unit from today onward. It would be an honor to share relevant combat experience with everyone.
BossGager|GAIN01|Gager, Sangvis Ferri Elite Doll, at your service starting from today.
BossGager|GAIN02|Since you already have information about me, please put my skills to good use.
BossGager|HELLO|Commander, what are our arrangements for today?
BossGager|FORMATION01|I can handle this alone.
BossGager|FORMATION02|Then please make haste. Don't keep me waiting.
BossGager|FORMATION03|Who will I be up against this time? I look forward to it.
BossGager|FEED01|Thank you, you've made the right decision.
BossGager|FEED02|I will not disappoint you.
BossGager|BREAKTHROUGH01|May I? You trust me so much... No, nothing...
BossGager|BREAKTHROUGH02|Commander, do you see now? This is how determined I am. From now on, I will dominate the battlefield.
BossGager|UPGRADE01|Thank you. In return, you can look forward to my performance.
BossGager|UPGRADE02|Allow me to try out this new power.
BossGager|DIALOGUE01|Don't let it get to your head, Architect. Remember who we are.
BossGager|DIALOGUE02|Can we...actually make friends with Griffin Dolls...?
BossGager|DIALOGUE03|As Sangvis Dolls, we only focus on efficiency. That's how we're different from the various weirdos in Griffin.
BossGager|GOATTACK|Don't worry, this won't take too long.
BossGager|MEET|Are you going to get down on your knees yourselves, or do you need some help from my bullets?
BossGager|ATTACK|Heed your order – advance!
BossGager|DEFENSE|Heed your order – defend!
BossGager|WIN|Victory can only belong to us. There is no other possibility.
BossGager|RETREAT|No, this can't be... There must be...some mistake...
BossGager|DEAD01|I actually lost...to such low-quality toys...
BossGager|DEAD02|Impossible... There must be...some mistake...
BossGager|SKILL01|Pitiful creatures. They are completely oblivious to their fate.
BossGager|SKILL02|You will regret challenging me in battle.
BossGager|SKILL03|Come forward and get down on your knees!
BossGager|FIX|Don't worry about me, Commander.
BossGager|BLACKACTION|Thank you for trusting me. Gager, setting off!
BossGager|SOULCONTRACT|Thank you, Commander. This really shows that I have your recognition. +All this time, I'm not sure if I'm being too hard on myself... +But now you've swept away all my doubts.
BossGager|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What do I wish for, you ask? N-nothing, really... As a Doll, serving faithfully at my post is my everything. You've already given me so much. I promise...I will repay you in kind.
BossGager|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
BossGager|PHRASE|Orders?
BossGager|MOOD1|Heh...
BossGager|MOOD2|Hmm?!
BossGager|LOWMOOD|I can't...
BossGager|APPRECIATE|Well done.
BossGager|AGREE|You're right.
BossGager|ACCEPT|I agree.
BossGager|FEELING|I expect nothing less from you.
BossGager|TIP|Here's some advice for you.
BossGager|LOADING|Waiting is also an important part of battle.

ZB26|GAIN|So this is Griffin? ...I see. Please look forward to my performance. I will do my best no matter where I am.
ZB26|HELLO|Welcome back, I've already sorted the documents you have to look through.
ZB26|FORMATION|You can put me anywhere you want. I will fight for you with all my strength.
ZB26|FEED|Please enhance my capabilities to the maximum, okay?
ZB26|DIALOGUE1|Do you know, Commander? One should always take the initiative to interact with others... That's why I've come and sought you out.
ZB26|DIALOGUE2|I often think...Dolls are so close to humans, but why do the majority of humans refuse to understand us?
ZB26|DIALOGUE3|The objects aren't placed properly on your desk. That's alright, I'll tidy it for you... What? You won't be able to find your things? That...that won't happen.
ZB26|BUILDOVER|The rookies are here. Why don't you come with me and have a look? One can only grow by interacting with all sorts of people.
ZB26|GOATTACK|Commencing mission. Let us spare no effort in completing it.
ZB26|MEET|Everyone, prepare to intercept the enemy.
ZB26|ATTACK|Don't be confused! Destroy all the enemies!
ZB26|DEFENSE|Adjust formation and delay them.
ZB26|BREAK|You'll pay...for pushing me so far!
ZB26|WIN|Victory in battle is merely the first step towards peace... Neither you nor I can relax.
ZB26|RETREAT|I'll cover the rear, everyone else please fall back.
ZB26|NEWYEAR|What kind of wish did you make for the new year? ...You want to know my wish? My wish is simple. I wish the desk in my dorm were perfectly square.
ZB26|VALENTINE|I made chocolate for you. Each piece has the same size, shape and calorie content.
ZB26|TANABATA|Tanabata is the only day Hikoboshi can meet Orihime, right... Perhaps their inability to meet frequently led to them cherishing each other more.
ZB26|ALLHALLOWS|If I told you I found a ghost, would you like to go see it with me? ...I know, right? Humans always say "they don't exist".
ZB26|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas! It's a time for shopping, and giving presents...and going on dates. Are you free later?
64typeMod|VALENTINE|I tried making matcha chocolate this year, but the recipe wasn't too complete, so... I made some adjustments to it. How does it taste?
ZB26|SKILL1|I'll use all my strength to defeat you in an instant!
ZB26|SKILL2|All I need to do is wipe you out!
ZB26|SKILL3|I won't take a step back!
ZB26|OPERATIONBEGIN|Leave it to me. I'll give my all even when it comes to logistics.
ZB26|OPERATIONOVER|Well? Are you happy with the result?
ZB26|FIX|I'm sorry... I overestimated myself.
ZB26|COMBINE|What if my Dummy doesn't have the same dimensions as me...
ZB26|BLACKACTION|Thank you for your trust. I will not disappoint you.
ZB26|SOULCONTRACT|Have you really considered this carefully? Once you've entered a contract with me... <>I won't let go of you no matter where you are… <>I will always, always be by your side.
ZB26|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
ZB26|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Even though I often say one mustn't give up halfway, your working hours are way too long... I am putting you on mandatory break for a while. Don't worry, I'll keep you company.
ZB26|Introduce|So this is Griffin? ...I see. Please look forward to my performance. I will do my best no matter where I am.
Webley|VALENTINE|I've brought chocolate...would you like some? ...If not, then I won't insist. After all, this is my first time making this sort of thing... Hey, don't snatch it away before I'm done talking... What? You like the taste? Whew, that's a relief.
Justice|LOADING|Commander, rumor has it that you've come up with a new plan, so Agent sent me to help.
Justice|TIP|I can handle this kind of mission on my own. Other Dolls will only slow me down...
Justice|FEELING|Yep.
Justice|ACCEPT|That's right.
Justice|AGREE|Ooh~
Justice|APPRECIATE|Haha!
Justice|LOWMOOD|Hmm...
Justice|MOOD2|Huh?
Justice|MOOD1|Haha.
Justice|PHRASE|Right away.
Justice|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, what's my mission today? Watching movies with you again...? Hmm, I don't mind.
Justice|SOULCONTRACT|...Does this mean I have your recognition?<>Thank you, Commander. You probably don't realize what this means to me...<>But I just want to confirm that you're not giving me this honor out of some strange fetish, are you?
Justice|BLACKACTION|I'm heading out. Contact me if there's anything urgent.
Justice|FIX|I shall return to my duties after a brief rest.
Justice|SKILL03|Before you die, take a good look at the difference between us!
Justice|SKILL02|Come forward, let me destroy you!
Justice|SKILL01|Cease your struggles and save yourself some unnecessary pain.
Justice|DEAD02|This isn't the end, nor should it be...
Justice|DEAD01|Don't...pity me. I...don't need your sympathetic gaze!
Justice|RETREAT|Sorry... I won't let this happen again.
Justice|WIN|Objective fulfilled, Commander. Your plan can carry on ahead.
Justice|DEFENSE|Hold position and stand by!
Justice|ATTACK|All forces, attack!
Justice|MEET|Humph, come at me all at once! I'm in a rush!
Justice|GOATTACK|Let's begin, but don't expect this to be a breeze.
Justice|DIALOGUE03|These Griffin Dolls have wildly varying combat capabilities... Commander, I suggest conducting some training to improve their overall performance. Look, here's my draft proposal...
Justice|DIALOGUE02|Commander, why are you gesturing at me behind my back? Are you laughing at my stature?! (Chambers weapon) 
Justice|DIALOGUE01|You know what, Commander? My auditory module is the best in Sangvis Ferri, so can you please stop leaning down when talking to me...?
Justice|UPGRADE02|I knew it. Getting stronger doesn't actually make me taller...
Justice|UPGRADE01|If I get stronger little by little, one day I might actually...uh, nothing.
Justice|BREAKTHROUGH02|Have I...grown just a bit taller?!
Justice|BREAKTHROUGH01|Humph, sending me off to fight again, huh? Not that I mind.
Justice|FEED02|That felt pretty good. You're surprisingly capable.
Justice|FEED01|Hmm, thank you, Commander.
Justice|FORMATION03|Time to show the newcomers what I've got.
Justice|FORMATION02|I shall lead everyone in completing this mission with flying colors.
Justice|FORMATION01|A wise and rational decision, Commander.
Justice|HELLO|Commander, there you are. Please issue your orders for today.
Justice|GAIN02|Sangvis Ferri, codena- Oh, it's you, Commander.
Justice|GAIN01|Sangvis Ferri, codename "Judge". Treat me well and I'll prove myself useful.
FO12|DIALOGUE1|My old job was all about searching and protecting. You can rest assured that I'm very experienced. Of course, I'm equally confident in my ability to complete whatever mission you give me!
FO12|DIALOGUE2|I believe there are ghosts at the base! Look at the mess they've made on your office desk! So scary... Oh, I'd better get back to work, see ya... Jack, let's get outta here!
FO12|DIALOGUE3|The others have been complaining about Jack chewing on their shields? Ahaha, sh-she's just testing out their defensive capability... Huh?! I need to submit a reflection report?!
FO12|BUILDOVER|More colleagues?! Jack, let's go!
FO12|GOATTACK|Leave the scouting to me! Let's go, team!
FO12|MEET|The enemy is ahead! Prepare to engage!
FO12|ATTACK|Heheh, getting bitten is gonna hurt!
FO12|DEFENSE|If you think you can get past us, think again!
FO12|BREAK|Ack! These guys are a pain...
M26MASS|GAIN|Hello, hello, hello! I'm M26-MASS! I'm officially a part of Griffin as of today! You're the Commander, right? If you need anything, just give me a shout. I'm always ready!
M26MASS|HELLO|What are we eating today, Commander?
M26MASS|FORMATION|Everyone behind me! I'm full of energy now that my belly is full!
M26MASS|FEED|Hm, that felt satisfying – like eating two slices of pineapple and lobster pizza!
M26MASS|DIALOGUE1|I feel like I've seen you before... Oh, I'm not trying to chat you up! Look into my sincere eyes and pure heart! Look at my... Hey, don't go!
M26MASS|DIALOGUE2|Wow, they're serving sausage pizza at the cafeteria today! But isn't that a bit heavy on its own? I'll cut some mango to add on top! Hm? I feel a gaze on me. Is it an assassin? How come there are assassins in Griffin's cafeteria?
M26MASS|DIALOGUE3|Commander, let's go on a team-building trip with some other Dolls! I'm bored out of my mind hanging around the base all day... Huh? Why don't I get people to join... I wouldn't be asking you if I could get them to listen... Uh, I mean...I just want to spend some time with you!
M26MASS|BUILDOVER|Wow, lemme check out which new friend is here... Hey, I know I've seen you somewhere!
M26MASS|GOATTACK|Don't worry, I've prepared plenty of rations!
M26MASS|MEET|Let's see what kind of idiot is fighting on the other side.
M26MASS|ATTACK|Heheh, this is my area of expertise!
M26MASS|DEFENSE|Hm, we should proceed with more caution.
M26MASS|TANABATA|They only get to meet once a year? What do they eat to mark such an occasion?
M26MASS|ALLHALLOWS|Jack-o'-lanterns... Candy corn... Hold on, I've got a brilliant idea! I'm gonna make a special Halloween pizza!
M26MASS|CHRISTMAS|How on earth does Santa Claus get inside people's homes? I could use that kind of skill. That way, I'll know what to do next time I get a door shut in my face!
M26MASS|SKILL2|Do you feel my might now?
M26MASS|SKILL3|You won't find any weakness in my defense!
M26MASS|FIX|I think I could use a second stomach.
M26MASS|BLACKACTION|Oh, so this is the strategy, yeah? I've got it down!
M26MASS|SOULCONTRACT|An oath? Haven't we been spending lots of time together already? <>Oh... So it will be an even more intimate relationship... I see... Commander, I totally understand what you're trying to get across! <>I'll save you the biggest slice next time I'm making fruit cocktail and seafood pizza!
M26MASS|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
Nova|ALLHALLOWS|Booooo! This evil spirit is here to take your life! Why are you laughing, boss? Can't evil spirits roller-skate?!
Nova|OPERATIONOVER|We're back! All the supplies are in one piece. This little dent shouldn't be a problem...
Nova|COMBINE|The figure skating team grows!
Nova|BLACKACTION|Just follow the same old beat. Relax, we've got this.
Nova|SOULCONTRACT|Boss, are you really swearing an oath with me? Then from this day forward... <>On Hawaiian pizza and pineapple chocolate pizza, on salad pizza and pasta pizza...  <>You must turn your back and choose only Italian pizza!
Nova|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
Nova|PHRASE|I got a brand new pair of roller skates~ ♪
Nova|TIP|GSh-18? She does look a bit like me. I'd love to have a chat with her some day.
Nova|LOADING|How about a roller dance to kill some time?
Nova|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Strange, I swear I smell American pizza in here, but it's just you...
Nova|Introduce|Open up, food delivery! Oops, my mistake... Let's try this again. Hello, boss. I'm Nova, and this is my partner Margherita!
MAG7|GAIN|Heheh~ The best esports Doll MAG-7 is here... WHAT?! You've never heard of me?! Log on real quick and we'll duke it out in Dust2! I'm gonna show you some mad skills!
MAG7|HELLO|Oh? If it isn't the Commander! How about a quick game with me later? I can boost you so fast it'll feel like a cheat!
MAG7|FORMATION|Not bad, not bad, these teammates feel pretty dependable!
MAG7|FEED|Oooooh! My APM is going through the roof! It's...at least 600 right now!
MAG7|DIALOGUE1|Commander, you can actually see this little guy? She's Ukwulu the evil spirit. Anyone who sees her will be cursed with perpetual one-bar WiFi... Hm? Why have you gone all pale? I'm just kidding!
MAG7|DIALOGUE2|Commander, you can't win against me even in fighting games. But you can try beating Ukwulu. As my partner, she's still on the level of pro players!
MAG7|DIALOGUE3|Hm? You want to know how I'm getting along with the others? Pretty well. Everyone is very nice, and I'm quite easy-going myse— Gosh darn it! That asshole is calling me a noob on Grif-chan again?! M! D! R!
MAG7|BUILDOVER|Oh? A new friend? I wonder how good of a gamer they are?
MAG7|GOATTACK|Rush B!
MAG7|MEET|I hope they'll keep us entertained for a bit~
MAG7|ATTACK|Come on, Ukwulu! Let's show them what a real attack looks like!
MAG7|DEFENSE|Go on the defensive for now and prepare to counterattack!
MAG7|BREAK|I'll make you regret making me get serious!
MAG7|WIN|Humph, these guys are even easier to kill than the stupid AI in Counter-Strike~
MAG7|RETREAT|Dammit... Just you wait!
MAG7|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander~ Look, this is such a lovely day, so how about giving your dear MAG-7 red packet money to buy the CS:GO Dragon Lore skin as a reward for a year of hard work?
MAG7|VALENTINE|Oh, Commander, you look miserable. I bet you haven't received any chocolate, eh? Look at my chocolate controller. Isn't it just delicious?
MAG7|ALLHALLOWS|Roar~ Happy Halloween, Commander! Wanna play some horror games with me? Ukwulu is such a scaredy-cat, she went poof the moment I brought up the idea. Surely you're not that much of a wimp, Commander?
MAG7|CHRISTMAS|Commander, I need your input! What should I get Ukwulu for Christmas this year? I gave her a copy of Sekiko: Shadows Die Thrice last year but for some reason she refused to talk to me for an entire week!
MAG7|SKILL1|I'll give you a single chance to beat me, noob~
MAG7|SKILL3|It's showtime for me and Ukwulu!
MAG7|OPERATIONBEGIN|Let's go, Ukwulu! We've got a delivery for the lazy-ass Commander.
MAG7|OPERATIONOVER|Commander, we're back~ Come over here! I've got a real surprise for you!
MAG7|FIX|Sorry, Commander. I won't get into such a mess next time.
MAG7|COMBINE|Humph, at this rate, I can actually form a team and win all the esports grand slams!
MAG7|BLACKACTION|Hm... I'll just leave everything to Ukwulu. It's just following instructions, isn't it?
MAG7|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, wanna duel me today— Holy! This is... <>Getting me to submit just because you can't beat me fair and square? That's low, Commander... But since you're being so sincere, I'll say yes! <>Just to make it clear—I have priority of use of the TV! You can't watch anime when I want to game!
MAG7|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
MAG7|PHRASE|One more game!
MAG7|TIP|What is it, Commander? Drooling at the sight of my PS-Box Elite Controller? Here, wanna play with it for a bit?
MAG7|LOADING|Hush... Camping takes patience.
MAG7|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, you saw my PS-Box Elite Controller, yeah? No, not the one in my pocket. We can't keep sharing a single controller forever, you know? Don't worry, I'll pick a more relaxing game this time. After all, I want you to have fun too.
MAG7|Introduce|Heheh~ The best esports Doll MAG-7 is here... WHAT?! You've never heard of me?! Log on real quick and we'll duke it out in Dust2! I'm gonna show you some mad skills!
FO12|ALLHALLOWS|Hey! Wanna see a terrifying monster? Ta-daaa! This is "Cerberus Jack" with two additional heads! Ahem... I'm just pulling your leg.
FO12|CHRISTMAS|Hey, that's my present! Give! It! Back! ...Oh! Y-You totally shredded it... Jack! You're not getting away with this!
FO12|SKILL1|Now!
FO12|SKILL2|You're not getting past me!
FO12|SKILL3|There's no escape for you!
FO12|OPERATIONBEGIN|Search and investigate? That's right up my alley!
FO12|OPERATIONOVER|I found a lot of cool stuff! Can I keep a share?
FO12|FIX|I think some of my limbs have fallen off... Jack?! How dare you make fun of me in my sorry state?!
FO12|COMBINE|Jack also got duplicated... Hold on, which one is the real Jack?!
FO12|BLACKACTION|I can do whatever I please throughout this operation? Heheh, don't blame me if anything bad happens!
FO12|SOULCONTRACT|It's kinda touching seeing you so sincere and solemn, but... <>To tell the truth, Jack also has feelings for you... Ahahaha, just kidding! <>Still, she seems happy to be our witness, which means...you have her approval!
FO12|TITLECALL|Girls' Frontline
FO12|PHRASE|Jack did it!
FO12|TIP|You can't find your work computer? Don't worry, you stuffed it into your locker in the changing room... Huh? How do I know? Ahem... Jack saw it.
FO12|LOADING|I'm bored... Jack, why don't we play Frisbee?
FO12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|It's your turn to walk Jack today? Be careful and keep her away from my colleagues, or she'll bolt and drag you along.
FO12|Introduce|ELID Disaster Rescue Guard Doll – Fostech Origin-12! My name is too much of a mouthful? Then just call me FO-12! This is my comrade-in-arms, Lightning Jack! We'll be under your command from now on!
M26MASS|OPERATIONBEGIN|Wow, looks like we'll be traveling pretty far, but that's alright, I'll prepare food for everyone!
M26MASS|OPERATIONOVER|Commander, I've brought back everything you need!
M26MASS|COMBINE|Come, my dear friends!
M26MASS|TIP|Ack, you stepped on me! Humph, as punishment, you're having snacks with me! Don't be a picky eater!
M26MASS|LOADING|Will it be too much of a rush to bake a pizza now?
M26MASS|Introduce|Hello, hello, hello! I'm M26-MASS! I'm officially a part of Griffin as of today! You're the Commander, right? If you need anything, just give me a shout. I'm always ready!
Nova|GAIN|Open up, food delivery! Oops, my mistake... Let's try this again. Hello, boss. I'm Nova, and this is my partner Margherita!
Nova|HELLO|Boss, I've collected your parcels for you.
Nova|DIALOGUE1|Throwing food into a customer's face? That's a stupid thing that I did in the past, but I've matured. Hang on, who the hell ordered American pizza?!
Nova|DEFENSE|Margherita, cover us!
Nova|BREAK|Ugh... Is everyone okay...?
Nova|WIN|Let me celebrate this victory with an inverted camel spin!
Nova|RETREAT|Dammit... I'll be back!
Nova|NEWYEAR|Wow, there are so many people here! Are they all here for their year-end bonus? Oh, mine is (muffled sound)— Huh? I can't tell others about it?
Nova|VALENTINE|Happy Valentine's Day, boss! Please accept my special pizza! I put a lot of effort into it! This is much tastier than chocolate, evil American pizza or whatnot...
Nova|TANABATA|If only Orihime and Hikoboshi knew how to roller-skate. That way, they could meet whenever they want and wouldn't have to meet just once a year! 
MAG7|SKILL2|It's time to get serious!
FO12|GAIN|ELID Disaster Rescue Guard Doll – Fostech Origin-12! My name is too much of a mouthful? Then just call me FO-12! This is my comrade-in-arms, Lightning Jack! We'll be under your command from now on!
FO12|HELLO|Commander, if you need a guard, just give me a holler! I'm a pro!
FO12|FORMATION|Huh?! Jack doesn't get his own seat?! Can't be helped then, we'll have to share one... Alright! Stop whining!
FO12|FEED|Did Jack also get a power-up? Wonderful! Look forward to our performance from now on!
FO12|WIN|Alright! Time to think about what reward to ask for!
FO12|RETREAT|Pressing on is too risky! Retreat!
FO12|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander! Do I get a bonus?
FO12|VALENTINE|Thanks for the chocolate, Commander... Hey! Jack! This isn't something you can eat... You're taking it by force?!
FO12|TANABATA|Jack may just be a bionic dog, but she still howls at the moon!
M26MASS|BREAK|...Just a bit longer... Dragonfruit pizza is waiting for me...
M26MASS|WIN|Humph, that was easy! Dinner is on me!
M26MASS|RETREAT|Ugh... A tactical retreat isn't a failure!
M26MASS|NEWYEAR|Huhhhhh? New Year? Will there be a celebration? There must be pizza at a celebration, right? I can help out in the kitchen— No, I won't sneak fruit in while it's baking in the oven, I swear!
M26MASS|VALENTINE|Valentine's Day, huh. Sounds like the perfect time to exchange presents! I'll start preparing 300 durian king crab pizza right away!
M26MASS|SKILL1|Charge! I'm itching for a fight!
M26MASS|PHRASE|Ehehehe!
M26MASS|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I thought I saw a few fellow pizza enthusiasts here just a second ago. Why have they gone?
Nova|FORMATION|It's okay even if you can't keep up with my speed; Margherita will keep you all safe!
Nova|FEED|This is how it feels to ride the wind!
Nova|DIALOGUE2|The best pizza needs to have a fresh crust, top-quality cheese, secret pizza sauce, and only the best toppings. It should taste natural and refreshing. No American pizza can compare to this!
Nova|DIALOGUE3|Boss, let's go mountain speed skating! Come and experience the thrill of free-falling down the mountain! Don't worry, visibility is very high today, so even if you fly off into the distance, I'll still be able to find you!
Nova|BUILDOVER|Please show the last four digits of your comms number to collect your meal... Uh, I mean, welcome to the Griffin base!
Nova|GOATTACK|Let's start this battle with a roller dance!
Nova|MEET|I bet those guys only eat American pizza!
Nova|ATTACK|Follow my beat! Charge!
Nova|CHRISTMAS|Hey, Santa Claus! Yes, you! Cease your futile struggle and let me catch up...! Huh, how could it be you, boss...?
Nova|SKILL1|Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates~ ♪
Nova|SKILL2|You got a brand new key~ ♪
Nova|SKILL3|I think that we should get together~ And try them out, you see~ ♪
Nova|OPERATIONBEGIN|You're confiscating my skates? No! I promise I won't send the supplies flying this time...
Nova|FIX|Can you upgrade my accelerator while you're at it?
MAG7|TANABATA|Looks like Hikoboshi is a pretty good gamer. After all, if your long-distance boyfriend is a noob and you can only see him once a year, you'll probably wanna dump him after a few years, right?
