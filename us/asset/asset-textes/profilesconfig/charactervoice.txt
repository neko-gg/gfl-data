xm3|DIALOGUE1|指挥官的过失，是会在人形上体现出来的，所以您需要时刻反省哦。
xm3|DIALOGUE2|今天的训练有几组人形表现太差了，指挥官，您想让这样的家伙成为我的同伴吗？

xm3|Wedding|指挥官，您一直都很在意我吗？<>也是呢……以我的性格，大概被您记恨很多次了吧……<>……诶？不是指这个？那是……诶！怎么会！？……我、我不是在做梦吧！……
xm3|Introduce|XM3是在USMC鲜为人知的一把枪，原本是为了弥补M40A3上一些性能的不足，由DARPA主导，IBA负责研制。最后在投入测试中倒也取得了不错的反响，不过我认为这并不是因为武器变得更优秀了，而是人们开始意识到自己的问题所在的缘故。
xm3|DIALOGUEWEDDING|指挥官，您明白上次约会错在哪了吗？……算了啦，如果您抱我一下的话，就原谅您好了……
xm3|GAIN|指挥官，怎么使用我都是您的自由，从现在起，请好好地利用这份力量吧。

Carcano1938_0|GAIN|指挥官，您好，如您所见，我是一位开朗活泼的人形，所以请让我们友好相处。
FN57_0|DIALOGUE1|指挥官要好好拉着我的手哦？不然您走散了我会很困扰的~
FN57_0|DIALOGUE2|眼光这东西得从小培养，不然长大了可是会养成FAL那样奇怪的品味呢。
FN57_0|DIALOGUE3|我很受大家欢迎呢，是因为我能听懂大家的话吗？
FN57_0|Wedding|指挥官……终于迎来这一刻了……<>接触的人和事太多了之后，反而连自己都有些迷失了，一直以来，是您在关键的时候把我拉了回来。<>感谢您，请让我今后留在您身边，成为您最信任的同伴吧。

Thunder50_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|黑色的翅膀虽然会带来不幸，但至少可以用来飞翔……指挥官，在“不幸”追上来之前，请一直陪着我前进吧。

GSH18|DIALOGUE1|嗯？怎么？有什么情况请及时和我讲啊指挥官。等等……！您在干什么呀！
GSH18|DIALOGUE2|上回的连载，我应该没有让人失望吧，应该……（小声）没有什么问题吧……大概……
GSH18|DIALOGUE3|指挥官——要活动一下吗？总是坐着对身体不好哦。（趴下做俯卧撑）嘿咻，1——2——3——
GSH18|Wedding|指挥官，如果不是您在我身边的话，我一定无法努力到现在……<>我一直期待着指挥官每一次的命令、夸奖、信任，还有……<>还有您现在……无比可靠的笑容。
GSH18|Introduce|GSh-18正式入列！不论是多么艰难的任务我都能完成！请随时派遣！

TAC50|DIALOGUE1|我的左眼能和“枫月”互通视野，也就是说，从“枫月”那里也能读取我的视觉画面哦。
TAC50|DIALOGUE2|我准备了一些甜点，枫糖浆土豆泥，枫糖浆棉花糖……嗯~不管哪一个都好好吃的样子！
TAC50|DIALOGUE3|指挥官，这是什么增进感情的方式吗？……好吧，我会尽力尝试配合的……
TAC50|Wedding|指挥官，我也不是什么事都能鼓起勇气去尝试的。<>能以这样的方式和您在一起，都是因为您给我的勇气……<>我希望……我们今后能一起努力，一起尝试更多快乐和幸福的事，好吗……？
TAC50|Introduce|指挥官，来到这里就意味着我能尝试各种各样的任务了吧？哼哼，我已经迫不及待了。
TAC50|DIALOGUEWEDDING|指挥官，我不在的时候可以把“枫月”放在身边哦，那样我就能远程协助您的工作了。
TAC50|GAIN|指挥官，来到这里就意味着我能尝试各种各样的任务了吧？哼哼，我已经迫不及待了。
M1014|DIALOGUE1|每次用公司的电梯都会让我提心吊胆的……只要超过3.54米的高度就会让我很不舒服。
M1014|DIALOGUE2|会议资料准备好了，我特地做了密文处理，这样即便泄露了也不会……哎？您看不懂吗？……现在学应该还来得及哦。
M1014|DIALOGUE3|这对“翅膀”吗？或许能飞吧，不过我恐高，所以从来没试过啦。
M1014|Wedding|指挥官，原来您为了这件事叫我出来啊。<>为什么不早点告诉我？这样的话我就可以多做一点准备，明明是那么重要的事……<>不用考虑太多吗？……我明白了，也许像这样简单一点，会比较好……❤
M1014|Introduce|请问您就是指挥官吗？真意外，没想到这么年轻呢，我还以为是更加成熟的那种类型……啊、失礼了！
M1014|DIALOGUEWEDDING|指挥官，这是我参考上次约会的数据做的下一次约会计划，当然这次也是用密文……喂、喂！为什么直接扔了啊!
M1014|GAIN|请问您就是指挥官吗？真意外，没想到这么年轻呢，我还以为是更加成熟的那种类型……啊、失礼了！
FP6|DIALOGUE1|外面好吵啊，该不会又是谁犯事儿了吧？哼哼……昨天新想的惩罚游戏好像就快派上用场了。
FP6|DIALOGUE2|长官，在我这块巧克力解决之后，会议也差不多要开始了，抓紧忙完手头的工作吧。
FP6|DIALOGUE3|在意我的发夹吗？这可是手铐的钥匙呢，小心别弄掉了哦。
FP6|Wedding|长官，从某种意义上来说，您也真是罪孽深重呢。<>为了拷牢您，光用这幅手铐看来是不够的。<>就让我用这份誓约，让您永远留在我的身边吧……❤

FP6|GAIN|哎呀抱歉……原来是新的长官啊，因为一脸可疑的样子，差点抓错人了呢。
AA12|DIALOGUE1|有些人形到底是怎么保养皮肤的？下次熬夜时在「倾述办公室」里问问好了……
AA12|DIALOGUE2|像原始人那样动用武力实在是太蠢了，身为先进的人形，就该用先进的方式解决问题。
AA12|DIALOGUE3|喂、喂！……你这是体罚吗？反对暴力！
AA12|Wedding|哈啊……没想到事态居然发展到了这种地步，该怎么办呢？<>这种场合的话必须正式一点吧？等我找找感觉啊……<>那个……指挥官，我、我很高兴和你……哎呀！反正就那个意思，你明白就好了……
AA12|Introduce|指挥官您好，我是AA-12，今后请多多……唔呕！不好……被突然一本正经的自己恶心到了。
AA12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|我在昨晚的「倾述办公室」里听到其他人形对指挥官的想法了……你这家伙，要是太花心了我可不介意动用暴力哦？
AA12|GAIN|指挥官您好，我是AA-12，今后请多多……唔呕！不好……被突然一本正经的自己恶心到了。
PM06|DIALOGUE1|要是宿舍里再多点红色的家具就好了……嘿嘿~指挥官，你有听见吧？
PM06|DIALOGUE2|打那种不见血的敌人真没意思，感觉完全就是浪费子弹嘛。

CETME556|DIALOGUE1|指挥官，能让我看一下您的作战计划吗？……原来如此，这就是我和您的差距吗……
CETME556|DIALOGUE2|556她们好像在玩什么好玩的东西……不、不行！现在是工作时间，不能去在意别的事。
CETME556|DIALOGUE3|这个箱子正好可以挡住我整个人呢，除了作战中能做掩护，捉迷藏的时候也很好用。
CETME556|Wedding|指挥官，我作为人形，虽然被很多人类依赖过……<>但只有您，是我唯一想要依赖的人。<>现在，能请您把您的肩膀借我一下吗？……谢谢配合。
CETME556|Introduce|您好，您就是我的指挥官吧，介意跟我握个手吗？……谢谢配合。
CETME556|DIALOGUEWEDDING|今天估计会忙个没完啊……真是的，等休息之后指挥官可得好好陪我放松一下啊。

OBR|DIALOGUE1|能再宽限两天吗？我马上就发工资了……啊、指挥官！没什么，只是奇怪的骚扰电话而已。
OBR|DIALOGUE2|指挥官，原来您也是人形啊，我居然一直都没发……谁说的？是希诺(Cino)告诉我的。
OBR|DIALOGUE3|好了好了我知道了，别再催我了，哎哟哟……
OBR|Wedding|指挥官，我明白自己已经在您身边欠下很多东西了。<>您的认可和信任，一直是我无以为报的宝物……<>如果一定要偿还，我愿用我的一切，回应您的心意。
OBR|Introduce|是指挥官吗？应该没认错人吧……只要在这里努力工作的话，我的债务问题就……嗯？没、没什么。
OBR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|指挥官，累了吧？剩下的任务交给我来处理就好了。这不是为了偿还什么，我只是想这么做而已。
OBR|GAIN|是指挥官吗？应该没认错人吧……只要在这里努力工作的话，我的债务问题就……嗯？没、没什么。
